... isrupting traditional museum layouts. Therefore, they might focus on how the adaptive architecture can enhance the 
... museum's appeal without overshadowing its exhibits. They would emphasize maintaining a balance between traditional 
... and futuristic elements to ensure the museum's identity remains intact.|Architect: Designs the physical layout and 
... structure of the museum. The architect is responsible for designing the physical layout and structure of the museum
... . They are interested in integrating technology seamlessly while ensuring the aesthetics and functionality of the s
... pace. Their focus might be on how the adaptive architecture can be incorporated into the museum's design without co
... mpromising its architectural integrity. They might emphasize the need for flexible spaces that can accommodate the 
... dynamic changes brought about by the adaptive architecture.|Educator: Develops educational programs and activities 
... for museum visitors. Educators are tasked with developing educational programs and activities for museum visitors. 
... They aim to enhance learning outcomes through interactive experiences. Their perspective might involve how adaptive
...  architecture can be leveraged to create engaging and educational exhibits. They would prioritize features that fac
... ilitate hands-on learning, interactive displays, and personalized educational content tailored to different age gro
... ups.|Technologist: Provides technical support for implementing adaptive architecture. Technologists provide technic
... al support for implementing adaptive architecture. They are driven by innovation and eager to explore cutting-edge 
... technologies. Their focus might be on the technical aspects of integrating AI-driven intelligent objects into the m
... useum environment. They would emphasize the need for robust infrastructure, seamless integration of hardware and so
... ftware, and scalability to accommodate future technological advancements.|Visitor: Represents the end-user experien
... ce. Visitors represent the end-user experience. They seek engaging and memorable experiences during museum visits. 
... Their perspective might involve how the adaptive architecture enhances their overall experience. They would priorit

... cases. You ALWAYS must satisfy the following 4 requirements for defining the use case diagram: 1) Each UML actor MU
... ST be linked to at least 1 UML use case. 2) Each UML use case MUST be linked to at least 1 UML actor OR MUST be poi
... nting to at least 1 other UML use case. 3) There is no UML actor to UML actor interaction. 4) A UML use case CAN be
...  linked to multiple UML actors. Add relationships with 'detailed descriptors'. Start the script with "graph LR". DO

Reflections and improvements:

1. Added new use cases for Visitor (Rate and Review Exhibits) linked to Administrator's Customize Exhibit 
Layouts.
2. Changed descriptors for better clarity, e.g., "Discover relevant exhibits" instead of "Receive 
Personalized Exhibit Recommendations."
3. Linked use cases across actors, e.g., Visitor's Rate and Review Exhibits impacts Administrator's Customize 
Exhibit Layouts.
4. Improved the layout of the script for better readability by adding more line breaks between sections.
