  "Build upon {key-gamlScriptDraft3}. Generate an `experiment {...}` block, with `output {...}` and `display {...}` blocks inside it. The code must provide the necessary attributes and logic to allow users to manipulate all {key-experimentalFactors}, make sure to include memorised {key-experimentalFactors} as `parameter` variables in the `experiment` block, so its values can be modified, each parameter must have a corresponding variable in the `global` block. **You must implement all the code necessary for the simulation to meet the memorised {key-objectives} and experiments must allow for the user to verify the memorised {key-hypotheses}**. Make sure to include performance metrics for the memorised {key-objectives} and {key-hypotheses}. Each `species` (and the `global` block) must include all required attributes and logic to compute all {key-outputs}. The `experiment` block must display all {key-outputs}. Any species you want to visually display must be declared in the `display` block in `experiment` and must have a corresponding `aspect` in their species block, in the format: `aspect <aspect_name e.g. base> {\\n\\tdraw <shape e.g. circle>(size) color: #color;\\n}`.

We defined model scope, roles, stakeholders, objectives, hypotheses, experimental factors, outputs, and UML artifacts—culminating in a comprehensive GAMA Markup Language (GAML) script. Two core objectives were crystallized: (1) quantifying resilience differences between planar and toroidal topologies via mean oscillation lifespans and spatial diversity indices, and (2) prototyping a hybrid simulation‐physical platform that drives self-healing materials and adaptive microgrids. The use case, class, state, and sequence diagrams ensured that our simulation architecture supports dynamic agent interactions, audit trails, and interactive visualization within an ethical governance framework.\n\nWe embedded all memorised {key-objectives} into global reflexes and species actions: lifespans and entropy metrics for Objective 1, self-healing cycle performance reports for Objective 2, and stakeholder engagement measures to address Hypothesis 2. While Hypothesis 1 on genetic tags increasing diversity by ≥15% awaits empirical execution, the GAML script exposes a `geneticTagMutationRate` parameter and collects spatial diversity outputs, thus furnishing the infrastructure needed for rigorous testing. The script also implements feedback-prompting reflexes and analytical methods to validate whether lineage visualization improves comprehension by ≥30%.\n\nTwo limitations remain. First, oscillator detection and pattern classification currently use placeholder stubs rather than robust morphological analysis, constraining the fidelity of diversity metrics. Second, stakeholder feedback is gathered through basic forms, lacking an immersive co-creation interface for deep comprehension assessment. Future work should integrate machine-learning–based pattern recognition modules or a repository of known Game of Life artifacts to refine metric accuracy, and develop a real-time, interactive UI (web or VR) to capture richer stakeholder engagement. Overall, the memorised {key-gamlScript} delivers a fully parameterized, multi‐species simulation platform that aligns with our objectives and hypotheses, while providing clear directions for enhancement.\n\nThe following association has been recorded:  \n• key-conclusion → The above conclusion text."
