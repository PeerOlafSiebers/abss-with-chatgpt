Actions accept arguments (enclosed in parentheses) or can accept no arguments. If any of the reflexes/actions need to interact with another species, use interactions in {key-mermaidSequenceDiagramScript} and relationships in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} to **connect the respective species using attributes, reflexes and actions**. All interactions between species must be defined inside the appropriate species block. For example, if a species named `species1` calls an action/reflex named `move()` belonging to itself or another species then make sure `move()` is implemented in the appropriate block. Make sure all actions/reflexes that are invoked have been fully implemented. **Implement interactions between agents, for example, add the following in an appropriate action/reflex of speciesA to interact with speciesB: ```gaml\\nspecies A {\\n\\taction <species_A_action_name> {\\n\\t\\task speciesB {\\n\\t\\t\\tdo <species_B_action_name>;\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```**. **The body of each action/reflex must be implemented FULLY**.

Generate an `experiment {...}` block, with `output {...}` and `display {...}` blocks inside it. The code must provide the necessary attributes and logic to allow users to manipulate all {key-experimentalFactors}, make sure to include memorised {key-experimentalFactors} as `parameter` variables in the `experiment` block, so its values can be modified. For example, if `temperature` is one of the chosen experimental factors, `temperature` must be a parameter variable in the `experiment` block. You must implement all the code necessary for the simulation to meet the memorised chosen {key-objectives} and experiments must allow for user to verify memorised chosen {key-hypotheses}. For example, if a chosen hypothesis is that a rise in temperature increases number of population of an animal, implement all the logic needed to check this is true (allow user to manipulate temperature, increment population, output population or display visually). Make sure to include performance metrics for the memorised chosen {key-objectives} and chosen {key-hypotheses}. Each `species` (and the `global` block) must include all required attributes and logic to compute all {key-outputs} (do NOT simply write boilerplate code, I REQUIRE A FULL IMPLEMENTATION). The `experiment` block must display all {key-outputs}. For example, if ratio of infected to recovered patients is a chosen output of a flu epidemic scenario, the ratio must be calculated and output. Any species you want to visually display must be declared in the `display` block in `experiment` and must have a corresponding `aspect` in their species block, in the format: `aspect base {\\n\\t\\tdraw circle(size) color: color;\\n\\t}`. All of this logic must be correctly implemented in the appropriate code blocks. If {key-outputs} would benefit from supplementary txt/csv files, also add logic to output them.

The simulation effectively integrates the memorised key stakeholders, UML actors, and their interactions, providing a robust framework for exploring the resilience of the Xylos ecosystem under various environmental conditions. The GAML script allows for the manipulation of key experimental factors, such as harvesting efficiency and resource availability threshold, enabling the verification of the memorised key hypotheses regarding the impact of these factors on the stability of the ecosystem. The simulation directly addresses the memorised key objectives by providing a platform for quantitative analysis of ecosystem health and providing insights into effective resource management strategies.\n\nThe simulation's ability to model the predator-prey cycle, incorporating behavioral adaptations and environmental stressors, provides a valuable tool for understanding the complex interplay of factors that influence ecosystem resilience. The GAML script facilitates the exploration of different intervention strategies, allowing for the assessment of their effectiveness in mitigating ecological crises and promoting long-term stability. The inclusion of collective classes, species, and aspects enables a detailed and visually rich representation of the ecosystem, enhancing the simulation's utility for both scientific research and educational purposes.\n\nHowever, the current simulation has limitations. Firstly, the model simplifies the complex interactions within the ecosystem, neglecting factors such as genetic diversity, disease dynamics, and the influence of external events. Secondly, the simulation lacks a detailed representation of the Shadowstalker's social structure, potentially overlooking the impact of social interactions on their behavior and resilience. Future work should focus on incorporating these factors to enhance the simulation's realism and predictive power. Additionally, exploring the integration of machine learning techniques to dynamically adapt the simulation's parameters based on real-time data could further improve its ability to model complex ecological systems.\n```\n\n{key-conclusion}: The Markdown document above provides a comprehensive conclusion of the entire conversation history, summarizing the achievements, limitations, and future directions of the Xylos Ecosystem Resilience Simulation.\n"}
