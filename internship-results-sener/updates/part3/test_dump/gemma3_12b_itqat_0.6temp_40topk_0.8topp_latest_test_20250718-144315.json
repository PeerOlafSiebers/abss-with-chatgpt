Implement the steps/pseudocode for all the methods inside the correct species; use `action` if the behaviour that is not expected to be invoked/executed at each timestep, or use `reflex` if the method is expected to be executed at each timestep. Make sure every species, reflex and action in the memorised {key-gamlScriptDraft} is fully implemented, YOU MUST THINK CAREFULLY AND STEP BY STEP WHEN IMPLEMENTING THE LOGIC. Make sure **every method declared in classes in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} is implemented as a reflex/action in the appropriate species**. Actions can be written using the following syntax: ```gaml\\nspecies <name> {\\n\\t<attribute_declaration_and_initialisation e.g. float probability <- 0.5;>\\n\\t<action if return type is void, else a type e.g. float> <action_name>(<parameters_if_any>) {\\n\\t\\t// logic e.g.\\n\\t\\tif(probability < 0.5) {\\n\\t\\t\\tprobability <- probability * 10;\\n\\t\\t\\t...\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```.

Actions accept arguments (enclosed in parentheses) or can accept no arguments. If any of the reflexes/actions need to interact with another species, use interactions in {key-mermaidSequenceDiagramScript} and relationships in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} to **connect the respective species using attributes, reflexes and actions**. All interactions between species must be defined inside the appropriate species block. For example, if a species named `species1` calls an action/reflex named `move()` belonging to itself or another species then make sure `move()` is implemented in the appropriate block. Make sure all actions/reflexes that are invoked have been fully implemented. **Implement interactions between agents, for example, add the following in an appropriate action/reflex of speciesA to interact with speciesB: ```gaml\\nspecies A {\\n\\taction <species_A_action_name> {\\n\\t\\task speciesB {\\n\\t\\t\\tdo <species_B_action_name>;\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```**. **The body of each action/reflex must be implemented FULLY**. For example, if you were implementing a ant-foraging model and wanted to implement an ant agent picking food up from a location, this could be implemented as: ```gaml\\naction pickUpFood (int amount) {\\n\\thas_food <- true;\\n\\tant_grid place <- ant_grid(location);\\n\\tplace.food <- place.food - amount;\\n}\\n```.

The code must provide the necessary attributes and logic to allow users to manipulate all {key-experimentalFactors}, make sure to include memorised {key-experimentalFactors} as `parameter` variables in the `experiment` block, so its values can be modified. For example, if `temperature` is one of the chosen experimental factors, `temperature` must be a parameter variable in the `experiment` block. You must implement all the code necessary for the simulation to meet the memorised chosen {key-objectives} and experiments must allow for user to verify memorised chosen {key-hypotheses}. For example, if a chosen hypothesis is that a rise in temperature increases number of population of an animal, implement all the logic needed to check this is true (allow user to manipulate temperature, increment population, output population or display visually). Make sure to include performance metrics for the memorised chosen {key-objectives} and chosen {key-hypotheses}. Each `species` (and the `global` block) must include all required attributes and logic to compute all {key-outputs} (do NOT simply write boilerplate code, I REQUIRE A FULL IMPLEMENTATION). The `experiment` block must display all {key-outputs}. For example, if ratio of infected to recovered patients is a chosen output of a flu epidemic scenario, the ratio must be calculated and output. Any species you want to visually display must be declared in the `display` block in `experiment` and must have a corresponding `aspect` in their species block, in the format: `aspect base {\\n\\t\\tdraw circle(size) color: color;\\n\\t}`.

Memorise this conclusion as {key-conclusion}.": "### Conclusion\n\nThe collaborative journey through agent-based modelling of an epidemic flu spread within Aethelgard has successfully achieved its primary aim: to generate a functional GAML simulation capable of exploring various intervention strategies and their impact on disease dynamics. The resulting {key-gamlScript} provides a robust foundation for investigating the interplay between individual behaviour, public health measures, and environmental factors. The simulation effectively incorporates the memorised {key-objectives}, allowing for the assessment of the cost-effectiveness of different interventions and the impact on community well-being. Furthermore, the simulation provides a platform to test the memorised {key-hypotheses}, such as the impact of mask-wearing and public health messaging on transmission rates.\n\nHowever, several limitations were identified during the development process. Firstly, the model currently simplifies individual behaviour, assuming homogenous risk perception and adherence to guidelines. Secondly, the model does not account for spatial heterogeneity in population density and connectivity, potentially overlooking the impact of local factors on disease spread. These limitations restrict the model's ability to accurately reflect the complexities of real-world epidemic dynamics.\n\nLooking ahead, future work could address these limitations by incorporating more sophisticated behavioural models, accounting for individual differences in risk perception and adherence to guidelines. Additionally, incorporating spatial heterogeneity and network effects would enhance the model\u2019s realism and predictive power. Furthermore, extending the simulation to include economic factors and healthcare resource constraints would provide a more holistic assessment of the impact of epidemic interventions. The generated {key-gamlScript} serves as a valuable starting point for these future developments, providing a functional and adaptable framework for exploring the complexities of epidemic modelling.\n"}
