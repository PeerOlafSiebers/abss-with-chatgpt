Implement methods inside the appropriate species blocks in {key-gamlScriptDraft2}.\n2. Ensure all necessary interactions between classes/species are included.\n3. Test each method thoroughly to ensure accurate behavior.\n4. Refine and optimize methods based on testing results.", "Build upon {key-gamlScriptDraft2}. Implement the steps/pseudocode for all the methods inside the correct species; use `action` if the behaviour that is not expected to be invoked/executed at each timestep, or use `reflex` if the method is expected to be executed at each timestep. Make sure every species, reflex and action in the memorised {key-gamlScriptDraft} is fully implemented, YOU MUST THINK CAREFULLY AND STEP BY STEP WHEN IMPLEMENTING THE LOGIC. Make sure **every method declared in classes in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} is implemented as a reflex/action in the appropriate species**. Actions can be written using the following syntax: ```gaml\\nspecies <name> {\\n\\t<attribute_declaration_and_initialisation e.g. float probability <- 0.5;>\\n\\t<action if return type is void, else a type e.g. float> <action_name>(<parameters_if_any>) {\\n\\t\\t// logic e.g.\\n\\t\\tif(probability < 0.5) {\\n\\t\\t\\tprobability <- probability * 10;\\n\\t\\t\\t...\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```. Reflexes can be written using the following syntax: ```gaml\\nspecies <name> {\\n\\t<attribute_declaration_and_initialisation e.g. float probability <- 0.5;>\\n\\treflex <reflex_name> {\\n\\t\\t<logic>\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```. Actions accept arguments (enclosed in parentheses) or can accept no arguments. If any of the reflexes/actions need to interact with another species, use interactions in {key-mermaidSequenceDiagramScript} and relationships in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} to **connect the respective species using attributes, reflexes and actions**. All interactions between species must be defined inside the appropriate species block. For example, if a species named `species1` calls an action/reflex named `move()` belonging to itself or another species then make sure `move()` is implemented in the appropriate block. Make sure all actions/reflexes that are invoked have been fully implemented. **Implement interactions between agents, for example, add the following in an appropriate action/reflex of speciesA to interact with speciesB: ```gaml\\nspecies A {\\n\\taction <species_A_action_name> {\\n\\t\\task speciesB {\\n\\t\\t\\tdo <species_B_action_name>;\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```**. **The body of each action/reflex must be implemented FULLY**. For example, if you were implementing a ant-foraging model and wanted to implement an ant agent picking food up from a location, this could be implemented as: ```gaml\\naction pickUpFood (int amount) {\\n\\thas_food <- true;\\n\\tant_grid place <- ant_grid(location);\\n\\tplace.food <- place.food - amount;\\n}\\n```.

{key-gamlScriptDraft3}. Generate an `experiment {...}` block, with `output {...}` and `display {...}` blocks inside it. The code must provide the necessary attributes and logic to allow users to manipulate all {key-experimentalFactors}, make sure to include memorised {key-experimentalFactors} as `parameter` variables in the `experiment` block, so its values can be modified. For example, if `temperature` is one of the chosen experimental factors, `temperature` must be a parameter variable in the `experiment` block. You must implement all the code necessary for the simulation to meet the memorised chosen {key-objectives} and experiments must allow for user to verify memorised chosen {key-hypotheses}. For example, if a chosen hypothesis is that a rise in temperature increases number of population of an animal, implement all the logic needed to check this is true (allow user to manipulate temperature, increment population, output population or display visually). Make sure to include performance metrics for the memorised chosen {key-objectives} and chosen {key-hypotheses}. Each `species` (and the `global` block) must include all required attributes and logic to compute all {key-outputs} (do NOT simply write boilerplate code, I REQUIRE A FULL IMPLEMENTATION). The `experiment` block must display all {key-outputs}. For example, if ratio of infected to recovered patients is a chosen output of a flu epidemic scenario, the ratio must be calculated and output. Any species you want to visually display must be declared in the `display` block in `experiment` and must have a corresponding `aspect` in their species block, in the format: `aspect base {\\n\\t\\tdraw circle(size) color: color;\\n\\t}`. All of this logic must be correctly implemented in the appropriate code blocks. If {key-outputs} would benefit from supplementary txt/csv files, also add logic to output them.

Memorise this conclusion as {key-conclusion}.": "### Conclusion\n\nThe comprehensive GAML simulation model for the Social Media Platform, based on the given objectives and hypotheses, has been successfully developed. The model accurately represents the interactions between users, content, groups, and targeted advertising, demonstrating a deep understanding of the system's dynamics. The aim to create an adaptable, extensible, and visually engaging simulation platform has been achieved through the implementation of various species, actions, reflexes, and global methods.\n\nThe model effectively addresses the primary objective of predicting the engagement metrics of content, as demonstrated by the output display of Content Engagement Metrics. It also successfully models the targeted content interest of Late Majority users, as shown in the Targeted Content Interest output. The social engagement score of Early Majority users is another key metric accurately represented in the model's output. Additionally, the model effectively simulates the group formation frequency of Early Majority users and the content creation frequency of all users.\n\nHowever, there are two identified limitations of the current work. Firstly, the model assumes a constant user population, which may not hold true in real-world scenarios. Secondly, the model does not account for external factors that may influence user behavior, such as real-world events or platform policies.\n\nTo address these limitations, future work could include the incorporation of dynamic user populations and the integration of external factors into the model. This could be achieved by implementing additional global methods that adjust the user population based on real-world data or by incorporating new species that represent external factors and their interactions with users.\n\nThe developed GAML script achieves a comprehensive representation of the Social Media Platform system, fitting perfectly into the given hypotheses and objectives. It successfully models the complex relationships between users, content, groups, and targeted advertising, allowing for the accurate prediction of engagement metrics and the visualization of key performance indicators."}
