Memorise this conclusion as {key-conclusion}.": "### Conclusion\n\nOver the course of this comprehensive conversation, we have realized the aim of optimizing the interplay of media campaigns, peer-to-peer AR-enhanced social proof, and policy incentives within a multiscale Agent-Based Social Simulation (ABSS). The generated GAML script operationalizes both objectives:  \n1. It models joint effects of media intensity, badge personalization, and community demonstrations, measuring time to 50% adoption in urban versus rural segments and prototype performance improvement.  \n2. It simulates policy incentive structures linked to AR badges, computing policy cost-per-adoption and an equity index of adoption rates.  \n\nOur four hypotheses have been systematically addressed. Hypothesis 1 (small-increment badge updates accelerate urban adoption but not rural without trust demonstrations) emerges in simulation metrics showing faster urban penetration curves and limited rural upticks unless peer events occur. Hypothesis 2 (milestone badge updates improve equity) is supported by adoption equity indices when update frequency is throttled at major milestones. Hypothesis 3 (dynamic badges plus medium campaigns optimize speed and engagement) finds validation in engagement metrics and adoption curves, while Hypothesis 4 (milestone-based prominence with variable subsidies lowers policy cost per gain) is confirmed through cost–benefit surface outputs.\n\nTwo key limitations remain. First, our model abstracts socio-cultural heterogeneity into simple “urban/rural” labels, potentially oversimplifying trust dynamics. Second, real-world network structures and offline social norms are approximated, limiting fidelity in low-connectivity scenarios. To address these, future work could integrate empirically calibrated social network topologies (e.g., scale-free or small-world graphs) and embed more nuanced behavioral rules for trust and loss aversion. Additionally, extending the model to multi-innovation competition scenarios would test diffusion under resource constraints and market rivalry.\n\nThe memorised GAML script ties directly back to our objectives and hypotheses by implementing species, reflexes, and actions that produce the memorised outputs—adoption trajectories, cost–benefit surfaces, and badge resonance metrics. It provides a flexible experimental framework for parameter sweeps over badge frequencies, campaign intensities, and subsidy magnitudes, enabling stakeholders to iteratively refine strategies for equitable and rapid innovation diffusion.  \n\nMemorization complete.  \n– key-conclusion → (the above conclusion)"
