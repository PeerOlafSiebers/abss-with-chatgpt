Implement the steps/pseudocode for all the methods inside the correct species; use `action` if the behaviour that is not expected to be invoked/executed at each timestep, or use `reflex` if the method is expected to be executed at each timestep. Make sure every species, reflex and action in the memorised {key-gamlScriptDraft} is fully implemented, YOU MUST THINK CAREFULLY AND STEP BY STEP WHEN IMPLEMENTING THE LOGIC. Make sure **every method declared in classes in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} is implemented as a reflex/action in the appropriate species**. Actions can be written using the following syntax: ```gaml\\nspecies <name> {\\n\\t<attribute_declaration_and_initialisation e.g. float probability <- 0.5;>\\n\\t<action if return type is void, else a type e.g. float> <action_name>(<parameters_if_any>) {\\n\\t\\t// logic e.g.\\n\\t\\tif(probability < 0.5) {\\n\\t\\t\\tprobability <- probability * 10;\\n\\t\\t\\t...\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```. Reflexes can be written using the following syntax: ```gaml\\nspecies <name> {\\n\\t<attribute_declaration_and_initialisation e.g. float probability <- 0.5;>\\n\\treflex <reflex_name> {\\n\\t\\t<logic>\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```. Actions accept arguments (enclosed in parentheses) or can accept no arguments. If any of the reflexes/actions need to interact with another species, use interactions in {key-mermaidSequenceDiagramScript} and relationships in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} to **connect the respective species using attributes, reflexes and actions**. All interactions between species must be defined inside the appropriate species block. For example, if a species named `species1` calls an action/reflex named `move()` belonging to itself or another species then make sure `move()` is implemented in the appropriate block. Make sure all actions/reflexes that are invoked have been fully implemented. **Implement interactions between agents, for example, add the following in an appropriate action/reflex of speciesA to interact with speciesB: ```gaml\\nspecies A {\\n\\taction <species_A_action_name> {\\n\\t\\task speciesB {\\n\\t\\t\\tdo <species_B_action_name>;\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```**. **The body of each action/reflex must be implemented FULLY**. For example, if you were implementing a ant-foraging model and wanted to implement an ant agent picking food up from a location, this could be implemented as: ```gaml\\naction pickUpFood (int amount) {\\n\\thas_food <- true;\\n\\tant_grid place <- ant_grid(location);\\n\\tplace.food <- place.food - amount;\\n}\\n```. If the action should return a value, replace `action` keyword with return type.

The code must provide the necessary attributes and logic to allow users to manipulate all {key-experimentalFactors}, make sure to include memorised {key-experimentalFactors} as `parameter` variables in the `experiment` block, so its values can be modified. For example, if `temperature` is one of the chosen experimental factors, `temperature` must be a parameter variable in the `experiment` block. You must implement all the code necessary for the simulation to meet the memorised chosen {key-objectives} and experiments must allow for user to verify memorised chosen {key-hypotheses}. For example, if a chosen hypothesis is that a rise in temperature increases number of population of an animal, implement all the logic needed to check this is true (allow user to manipulate temperature, increment population, output population or display visually). Make sure to include performance metrics for the memorised chosen {key-objectives} and chosen {key-hypotheses}. Each `species` (and the `global` block) must include all required attributes and logic to compute all {key-outputs} (do NOT simply write boilerplate code, I REQUIRE A FULL IMPLEMENTATION). The `experiment` block must display all {key-outputs}. For example, if ratio of infected to recovered patients is a chosen output of a flu epidemic scenario, the ratio must be calculated and output. Any species you want to visually display must be declared in the `display` block in `experiment` and must have a corresponding `aspect` in their species block, in the format: `aspect base {\\n\\t\\tdraw circle(size) color: color;\\n\\t}`.

The model successfully integrates key factors influencing disease transmission, including individual behaviors, urban infrastructure, and public health interventions, allowing for exploration of various scenarios and their potential impact. The successful implementation of the model allows for the verification of several hypotheses, including the influence of temperature on infection rates and the effectiveness of mask-wearing campaigns. The model provides a platform for testing different intervention strategies and optimizing resource allocation to mitigate the impact of the epidemic. The simulation effectively addresses the key objectives by providing a dynamic and interactive environment for analyzing the complex interplay of factors influencing disease spread.\n\nDespite the achievements, several limitations remain. Firstly, the model simplifies individual behaviors, assuming a binary choice between mask-wearing and non-mask-wearing, neglecting the nuances of human decision-making. Secondly, the model lacks a detailed representation of the urban environment, failing to account for factors such as population density, transportation networks, and social interactions. These limitations restrict the model\u2019s ability to accurately predict real-world epidemic scenarios.\n\nFuture work should focus on incorporating more realistic behavioral models, accounting for factors such as risk perception, social influence, and compliance fatigue. Furthermore, the model should be extended to include a more detailed representation of the urban environment, integrating data on population density, transportation networks, and social interactions. Exploring the integration of machine learning techniques to dynamically adjust parameters based on real-time data could also enhance the model\u2019s predictive capabilities. The {key-gamlScript} provides a robust foundation for these future developments, enabling the exploration of increasingly complex and realistic epidemic scenarios.\n```\n"}
