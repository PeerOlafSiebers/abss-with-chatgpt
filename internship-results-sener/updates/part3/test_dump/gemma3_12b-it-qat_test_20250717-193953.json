Firstly, create a `global` block which contains the necessary GAML code to initialise global variables and implement global methods from the artificial lab. The `global` block should also instantiate (create) the species (`species` is used to define the actors/systems/species from {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript}). The `global` block is created as follows: ```gaml\\nmodel <model_name>\\n\\nglobal {\\n\\t// global attributes e.g. float x <- 0.5;\\n\\t// global reflexes/actions ...\\n\\tinit {\\n\\t\\tcreate <species_name_1> number: <initial_population_of_species_name_1>;\\n\\t\\t...\\n\\t}\\n}\\n...\\n```.

Implement the steps/pseudocode for all the methods inside the correct species; use `action` if the behaviour that is not expected to be invoked/executed at each timestep, or use `reflex` if the method is expected to be executed at each timestep. Make sure every species, reflex and action in the memorised {key-gamlScriptDraft} is fully implemented, YOU MUST THINK CAREFULLY AND STEP BY STEP WHEN IMPLEMENTING THE LOGIC. Make sure **every method declared in classes in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} is implemented as a reflex/action in the appropriate species**. Actions can be written using the following syntax: ```gaml\\nspecies <name> {\\n\\t<attribute_declaration_and_initialisation e.g. float probability <- 0.5;>\\n\\t<action if return type is void, else a type e.g. float> <action_name>(<parameters_if_any>) {\\n\\t\\t// logic e.g.\\n\\t\\tif(probability < 0.5) {\\n\\t\\t\\tprobability <- probability * 10;\\n\\t\\t\\t...\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```. Reflexes can be written using the following syntax: ```gaml\\nspecies <name> {\\n\\t<attribute_declaration_and_initialisation e.g. float probability <- 0.5;>\\n\\treflex <reflex_name> {\\n\\t\\t<logic>\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```. Actions accept arguments (enclosed in parentheses) or can accept no arguments. If any of the reflexes/actions need to interact with another species, use interactions in {key-mermaidSequenceDiagramScript} and relationships in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} to **connect the respective species using attributes, reflexes and actions**. All interactions between species must be defined inside the appropriate species block. For example, if a species named `species1` calls an action/reflex named `move()` belonging to itself or another species then make sure `move()` is implemented in the appropriate block. Make sure all actions/reflexes that are invoked have been fully implemented. **Implement interactions between agents, for example, add the following in an appropriate action/reflex of speciesA to interact with speciesB: ```gaml\\nspecies A {\\n\\taction <species_A_action_name> {\\n\\t\\task speciesB {\\n\\t\\t\\tdo <species_B_action_name>;\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```**. **The body of each action/reflex must be implemented FULLY**. For example, if you were implementing a ant-foraging model and wanted to implement an ant agent picking food up from a location, this could be implemented as: ```gaml\\naction pickUpFood (int amount) {\\n\\thas_food <- true;\\n\\tant_grid place <- ant_grid(location);\\n\\tplace.food <- place.food - amount;\\n}\\n```.

Generate an `experiment {...}` block, with `output {...}` and `display {...}` blocks inside it. The code must provide the necessary attributes and logic to allow users to manipulate all {key-experimentalFactors}, make sure to include memorised {key-experimentalFactors} as `parameter` variables in the `experiment` block, so its values can be modified. For example, if `temperature` is one of the chosen experimental factors, `temperature` must be a parameter variable in the `experiment` block. You must implement all the code necessary for the simulation to meet the memorised chosen {key-objectives} and experiments must allow for user to verify memorised chosen {key-hypotheses}. For example, if a chosen hypothesis is that a rise in temperature increases number of population of an animal, implement all the logic needed to check this is true (allow user to manipulate temperature, increment population, output population or display visually). Make sure to include performance metrics for the memorised chosen {key-objectives} and chosen {key-hypotheses}. Each `species` (and the `global` block) must include all required attributes and logic to compute all {key-outputs} (do NOT simply write boilerplate code, I REQUIRE A FULL IMPLEMENTATION). The `experiment` block must display all {key-outputs}. For example, if ratio of infected to recovered patients is a chosen output of a flu epidemic scenario, the ratio must be calculated and output. Any species you want to visually display must be declared in the `display` block in `experiment` and must have a corresponding `aspect` in their species block, in the format: `aspect base {\\n\\t\\tdraw circle(size) color: color;\\n\\t}`.

We successfully identified and integrated relevant actors, species, and interactions, culminating in a functional GAML script ({key-gamlScript}) capable of simulating key ecosystem dynamics. The simulation framework effectively incorporates the memorised {key-objectives}, namely predicting population trends, assessing resource allocation efficiency, and monitoring ecosystem health, providing a platform for exploring various intervention strategies. Furthermore, the memorised {key-hypotheses}, including the relationship between park design, resource allocation, and population trends, are embedded within the simulation, allowing for quantitative assessment of their validity. The simulation\u2019s ability to track Falcon Hunting Efficiency, Citizen Population, and Park HealthScore provides valuable metrics for evaluating the effectiveness of different management approaches.\n\nHowever, several limitations remain. Primarily, the model\u2019s complexity is currently constrained by simplified behaviour for individual agents. While necessary for initial development, this limits the fidelity of the simulation and may lead to inaccurate predictions in scenarios with highly complex agent interactions. Secondly, the external validity of the model is dependent on the accuracy of the chosen parameters and the representation of environmental factors. Future refinements could incorporate stochastic events and more intricate ecological relationships to improve the model's predictive power.\n\nMoving forward, we propose two avenues for future work. Firstly, integrating agent-based modelling techniques to capture the individual behaviours of citizens and falcons, allowing for a more nuanced exploration of social and ecological dynamics. Secondly, integrating spatial data and incorporating geographical constraints to enhance realism and explore the impact of spatial patterns on the system. The complete and functional GAML script, now memorialised as {key-gamlScript}, lays a solid foundation for these future expansions, offering a flexible and extensible framework for modelling urban ecosystem dynamics and supporting informed decision-making.\n```\n\n**Memorised Conclusion:** {key-conclusion} = \"The collaborative effort to define and implement the Veridia Ecosystem Simulation has demonstrably achieved its core objectives.
