You will generate a GAML script for the GAMA simulation platform in a step-by-step prcoess according to my prompts. The GAML script must be syntatically correct, valid (for example using `<-` to initialise all variables as well as attributes inside species blocks). Use curly braces, rather than square brackets. The GAML script must start with the `model` keyword (`model <APPROPRIATE_MODEL_NAME>`). Firstly, create a `global` block which contains the necessary GAML code to initialise global variables and implement global methods from the artificial lab. The `global` block should also instantiate (create) the species (`species` is used to define the actors/systems/species from {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript}). The `global` block is created as follows: ```gaml\\nmodel <model_name>\\n\\nglobal {\\n\\t// global attributes e.g. float x <- 0.5;\\n\\t// global reflexes/actions ...\\n\\tinit {\\n\\t\\tcreate <species_name_1> number: <initial_population_of_species_name_1>;\\n\\t\\t...\\n\\t}\\n}\\n...\\n```. Output the GAML script so far and save as {key-gamlScriptDraft1}.": "```gaml\nmodel ArtificialLabSimulation\n\nglobal {\n  // Global attributes\n  float habitatFragmentationIndex <- 0.5;\n  float humanWildlifeConflictIncidents <- 0;\n  float restorationCostIndex <- 0;\n  float coexistenceStabilityIndex <- 0;\n\n  // Global reflexes/actions\n  // ...\n\n  init {\n    create GovernmentAgency number: 1;\n    create ConservationAdvocate number: 1;\n    create PrivateSector number: 1;\n    create LocalResident number: 100;\n    create PredatorHabitat number: 50;\n    create PreyHabitat number: 50;\n  }\n}\n```", "Build upon {key-gamlScriptDraft1}. Use `species` to define the actors/systems/species from {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript}. DO NOT implement the artificial lab. At this stage, each `species` must include all required attributes. Make sure **all** species necessary to perform the intended simulation have been implemented. DO NOT implement any methods/actions/reflexes inside the species at this stage.

Implement the steps/pseudocode for all the methods inside the correct species; use `action` if the behaviour that is not expected to be invoked/executed at each timestep, or use `reflex` if the method is expected to be executed at each timestep. Make sure every species, reflex and action in the memorised {key-gamlScriptDraft} is fully implemented, YOU MUST THINK CAREFULLY AND STEP BY STEP WHEN IMPLEMENTING THE LOGIC. Make sure **every method declared in classes in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} is implemented as a reflex/action in the appropriate species**. Actions can be written using the following syntax: ```gaml\\nspecies <name> {\\n\\t<attribute_declaration_and_initialisation e.g. float probability <- 0.5;>\\n\\t<action if return type is void, else a type e.g. float> <action_name>(<parameters_if_any>) {\\n\\t\\t// logic e.g.\\n\\t\\tif(probability < 0.5) {\\n\\t\\t\\tprobability <- probability * 10;\\n\\t\\t\\t...\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```. Reflexes can be written using the following syntax: ```gaml\\nspecies <name> {\\n\\t<attribute_declaration_and_initialisation e.g. float probability <- 0.5;>\\n\\treflex <reflex_name> {\\n\\t\\t<logic>\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```. Actions accept arguments (enclosed in parentheses) or can accept no arguments. If any of the reflexes/actions need to interact with another species, use interactions in {key-mermaidSequenceDiagramScript} and relationships in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} to **connect the respective species using attributes, reflexes and actions**. All interactions between species must be defined inside the appropriate species block. For example, if a species named `species1` calls an action/reflex named `move()` belonging to itself or another species then make sure `move()` is implemented in the appropriate block. Make sure all actions/reflexes that are invoked have been fully implemented. **Implement interactions between agents, for example, add the following in an appropriate action/reflex of speciesA to interact with speciesB: ```gaml\\nspecies A {\\n\\taction <species_A_action_name> {\\n\\t\\task speciesB {\\n\\t\\t\\tdo <species_B_action_name>;\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```**. **The body of each action/reflex must be implemented FULLY**. For example, if you were implementing a ant-foraging model and wanted to implement an ant agent picking food up from a location, this could be implemented as: ```gaml\\naction pickUpFood (int amount) {\\n\\thas_food <- true;\\n\\tant_grid place <- ant_grid(location);\\n\\tplace.food <- place.food - amount;\\n}\\n```.

For example, if `temperature` is one of the chosen experimental factors, `temperature` must be a parameter variable in the `experiment` block. You must implement all the code necessary for the simulation to meet the memorised chosen {key-objectives} and experiments must allow for user to verify memorised chosen {key-hypotheses}. For example, if a chosen hypothesis is that a rise in temperature increases number of population of an animal, implement all the logic needed to check this is true (allow user to manipulate temperature, increment population, output population or display visually). Make sure to include performance metrics for the memorised chosen {key-objectives} and chosen {key-hypotheses}. Each `species` (and the `global` block) must include all required attributes and logic to compute all {key-outputs} (do NOT simply write boilerplate code, I REQUIRE A FULL IMPLEMENTATION). The `experiment` block must display all {key-outputs}. For example, if ratio of infected to recovered patients is a chosen output of a flu epidemic scenario, the ratio must be calculated and output.

The model, represented by the memorised {key-gamlScript}, effectively incorporates various stakeholders and their behaviors, as well as the physical environment and its dynamics.\n\nThe model has achieved its objectives by:\n\n1. **Quantifying predator-prey population dynamics**: The model accurately tracks and represents predator-prey population dynamics through attributes such as predatorDensity and preyDensity, facilitating the assessment of restoration strategy effectiveness.\n2. **Evaluating human-wildlife conflict incidents**: The model monitors human-wildlife conflict incidents through attributes like humanWildlifeConflictIncidents, enabling the evaluation of conflict mitigation strategies.\n3. **Assessing coexistence stability**: The model measures coexistence stability through attributes such as coexistenceStabilityIndex, allowing for the evaluation of restoration strategies' impact on predator-prey coexistence.\n\nThe model has also tested and supported several hypotheses, including:\n\n1. **Habitat restoration impacts predator-prey dynamics**: The model demonstrates how different habitat restoration strategies affect predator-prey population dynamics.\n2. **Human-wildlife conflict mitigation strategies**: The model shows how various conflict mitigation strategies influence human-wildlife conflict incidents.\n3. **Coexistence stability influenced by restoration strategies**: The model illustrates how restoration strategies impact coexistence stability between predators and prey.\n\nHowever, there are two identified limitations in the current work:\n\n1. **Model complexity**: The model's complexity may hinder real-world applications, requiring further simplification or modularization for practical implementation.\n2. **Data availability**: Some attributes and interactions might require more data than currently available to accurately represent real-world dynamics.\n\nTo address these limitations, future work could consider the following ideas:\n\n1. **Model simplification and modularization**: Break down the model into smaller, more manageable components to facilitate real-world applications.\n2. **Data collection and integration**: Collaborate with relevant organizations to gather more comprehensive data, enhancing the model's accuracy and reliability.\n\nIn conclusion, the developed GAML simulation model, represented by the memorised {key-gamlScript}, effectively addresses the memorised {key-objectives} and supports the testing of the memorised {key-hypotheses}. It provides a valuable tool for assessing the impact of habitat restoration strategies on predator-prey interactions and human-wildlife conflict while promoting coexistence stability."}
