Using the ABSS model, we can simulate the impact of different teacher characteristics (e.g., experience, training, network centrality) on the diffusion rate. By identifying these influential figures, the district can strategically support them, providing them with resources and opportunities to share their expertise, thereby accelerating the adoption of innovative teaching methods across the entire system. This aligns with the {key-specialisation} of Innovation Diffusion Dynamics.\n\n**Idea 2: Resource Allocation Strategies:** The study can evaluate different resource allocation strategies for pedagogical innovation. The ABSS model can simulate the impact of varying levels of funding, training, and mentorship on the adoption rate. By experimenting with different scenarios, we can identify the most effective ways to allocate resources to maximize the spread of innovative teaching methods. This allows for data-driven decision-making regarding resource allocation, ensuring that investments are targeted towards strategies that yield the greatest impact on student learning. This aligns with the {key-domain} of Bass Diffusion Modeling.\n\n**Idea 3: Network Topology and Adoption:** This study can investigate the influence of school network topology on the adoption of new pedagogical approaches. The ABSS model can simulate different network structures (e.g., centralized, decentralized, hierarchical) and assess their impact on the diffusion rate. Understanding how the relationships between schools affect the spread of innovation can inform the design of interventions that promote collaboration and knowledge sharing, ultimately fostering a more resilient and adaptable educational system.

Implement the steps/pseudocode for all the methods inside the correct species; use `action` if the behaviour that is not expected to be invoked/executed at each timestep, or use `reflex` if the method is expected to be executed at each timestep. Make sure every species, reflex and action in the memorised {key-gamlScriptDraft} is fully implemented, YOU MUST THINK CAREFULLY AND STEP BY STEP WHEN IMPLEMENTING THE LOGIC. Make sure **every method declared in classes in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} is implemented as a reflex/action in the appropriate species**. Actions can be written using the following syntax: ```gaml\\nspecies <name> {\\n\\t<attribute_declaration_and_initialisation e.g. float probability <- 0.5;>\\n\\t<action if return type is void, else a type e.g. float> <action_name>(<parameters_if_any>) {\\n\\t\\t// logic e.g.\\n\\t\\tif(probability < 0.5) {\\n\\t\\t\\tprobability <- probability * 10;\\n\\t\\t\\t...\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```. Reflexes can be written using the following syntax: ```gaml\\nspecies <name> {\\n\\t<attribute_declaration_and_initialisation e.g. float probability <- 0.5;>\\n\\treflex <reflex_name> {\\n\\t\\t<logic>\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```. Actions accept arguments (enclosed in parentheses) or can accept no arguments. If any of the reflexes/actions need to interact with another species, use interactions in {key-mermaidSequenceDiagramScript} and relationships in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} to **connect the respective species using attributes, reflexes and actions**. All interactions between species must be defined inside the appropriate species block. For example, if a species named `species1` calls an action/reflex named `move()` belonging to itself or another species then make sure `move()` is implemented in the appropriate block. Make sure all actions/reflexes that are invoked have been fully implemented. **Implement interactions between agents, for example, add the following in an appropriate action/reflex of speciesA to interact with speciesB: ```gaml\\nspecies A {\\n\\taction <species_A_action_name> {\\n\\t\\task speciesB {\\n\\t\\t\\tdo <species_B_action_name>;\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```**. **The body of each action/reflex must be implemented FULLY**. For example, if you were implementing a ant-foraging model and wanted to implement an ant agent picking food up from a location, this could be implemented as: ```gaml\\naction pickUpFood (int amount) {\\n\\thas_food <- true;\\n\\tant_grid place <- ant_grid(location);\\n\\tplace.food <- place.food - amount;\\n}\\n```.

Generate an `experiment {...}` block, with `output {...}` and `display {...}` blocks inside it. The code must provide the necessary attributes and logic to allow users to manipulate all {key-experimentalFactors}, make sure to include memorised {key-experimentalFactors} as `parameter` variables in the `experiment` block, so its values can be modified. For example, if `temperature` is one of the chosen experimental factors, `temperature` must be a parameter variable in the `experiment` block. You must implement all the code necessary for the simulation to meet the memorised chosen {key-objectives} and experiments must allow for user to verify memorised chosen {key-hypotheses}. For example, if a chosen hypothesis is that a rise in temperature increases number of population of an animal, implement all the logic needed to check this is true (allow user to manipulate temperature, increment population, output population or display visually). Make sure to include performance metrics for the memorised chosen {key-objectives} and chosen {key-hypotheses}. Each `species` (and the `global` block) must include all required attributes and logic to compute all {key-outputs} (do NOT simply write boilerplate code, I REQUIRE A FULL IMPLEMENTATION). The `experiment` block must display all {key-outputs}. For example, if ratio of infected to recovered patients is a chosen output of a flu epidemic scenario, the ratio must be calculated and output. Any species you want to visually display must be declared in the `display` block in `experiment` and must have a corresponding `aspect` in their species block, in the format: `aspect base {\\n\\t\\tdraw circle(size) color: color;\\n\\t}`. All of this logic must be correctly implemented in the appropriate code blocks. If {key-outputs} would benefit from supplementary txt/csv files, also add logic to output them.

The simulation provides a dynamic environment for exploring the complex interplay between student performance, teaching strategies, and external factors like temperature, allowing for a nuanced understanding of educational dynamics. The successful implementation of the simulation enables the verification of the hypothesis that a rise in temperature negatively impacts student performance, as reflected in the simulation results and the generated performance data. The achievement of the objectives, including the ability to manipulate key parameters and visualize the resulting impact on student outcomes, demonstrates the potential of agent-based modeling for informing educational policy and practice.\n\nHowever, the current work is not without limitations. Firstly, the model simplifies the underlying cognitive processes of students and teachers, neglecting individual learning styles and pedagogical approaches in greater detail. Secondly, the model assumes a static environment, failing to account for the dynamic and evolving nature of educational systems. These limitations highlight the need for further refinement and expansion of the model to incorporate more realistic and nuanced representations of educational dynamics.\n\nFuture work should focus on incorporating more sophisticated cognitive models to better represent individual learning styles and pedagogical approaches. Additionally, the model should be extended to account for the dynamic and evolving nature of educational systems, incorporating factors such as changing demographics, technological advancements, and policy changes. The {key-gamlScript} serves as a foundation for these future developments, providing a robust and flexible platform for exploring the complex interplay of factors that shape educational outcomes. The ability to manipulate parameters and visualize results within the GAMA environment facilitates the testing of new hypotheses and the refinement of existing models, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of the educational process.\n```\n"}
