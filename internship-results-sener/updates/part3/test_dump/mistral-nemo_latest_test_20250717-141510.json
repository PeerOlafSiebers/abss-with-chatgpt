For example, if a species named `species1` calls an action/reflex named `move()` belonging to itself or another species then make sure `move()` is implemented in the appropriate block. Make sure all actions/reflexes that are invoked have been fully implemented. **Implement interactions between agents, for example, add the following in an appropriate action/reflex of speciesA to interact with speciesB: ```gaml\\nspecies A {\\n\\taction <species_A_action_name> {\\n\\t\\task speciesB {\\n\\t\\t\\tdo <species_B_action_name>;\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```**. **The body of each action/reflex must be implemented FULLY**. For example, if you were implementing a ant-foraging model and wanted to implement an ant agent picking food up from a location, this could be implemented as: ```gaml\\naction pickUpFood (int amount) {\\n\\thas_food <- true;\\n\\tant_grid place <- ant_grid(location);\\n\\tplace.food <- place.food - amount;\\n}\\n```. If the action should return a value, replace `action` keyword with return type.

Generate an `experiment {...}` block, with `output {...}` and `display {...}` blocks inside it. The code must provide the necessary attributes and logic to allow users to manipulate all {key-experimentalFactors}, make sure to include memorised {key-experimentalFactors} as `parameter` variables in the `experiment` block, so its values can be modified. For example, if `temperature` is one of the chosen experimental factors, `temperature` must be a parameter variable in the `experiment` block. You must implement all the code necessary for the simulation to meet the memorised chosen {key-objectives} and experiments must allow for user to verify memorised chosen {key-hypotheses}. For example, if a chosen hypothesis is that a rise in temperature increases number of population of an animal, implement all the logic needed to check this is true (allow user to manipulate temperature, increment population, output population or display visually). Make sure to include performance metrics for the memorised chosen {key-objectives} and chosen {key-hypotheses}. Each `species` (and the `global` block) must include all required attributes and logic to compute all {key-outputs} (do NOT simply write boilerplate code, I REQUIRE A FULL IMPLEMENTATION). The `experiment` block must display all {key-outputs}. For example, if ratio of infected to recovered patients is a chosen output of a flu epidemic scenario, the ratio must be calculated and output. Any species you want to visually display must be declared in the `display` block in `experiment` and must have a corresponding `aspect` in their species block, in the format: `aspect base {\\n\\t\\tdraw circle(size) color: color;\\n\\t}`. All of this logic must be correctly implemented in the appropriate code blocks. If {key-outputs} would benefit from supplementary txt/csv files, also add logic to output them.

Memorise this conclusion as {key-conclusion}.": "### Conclusion\n\nThe comprehensive GAML simulation platform for the Artificial Lab has been successfully developed, addressing the key objectives and hypotheses outlined at the outset of our conversation history. The platform, represented by the memorised {key-gamlScript}, achieves a significant milestone in implementing an adaptable, efficient, and visually engaging Agent-Based Social Simulation (ABSS) tool for exploring emergent patterns and dynamics in cellular automata simulations.\n\n**Achievement of Objectives:**\n- The platform effectively allows users to manipulate experimental factors, such as initial live cell density, grid size, neighborhood structure, game of life variations, and visualisation layers, catering to the objective of facilitating efficient exploration of different scenarios.\n- It provides meaningful visualisations and performance metrics, enabling users to understand simulation outputs and evaluate efficiency, aligning with the objective of enhancing user interaction and engagement.\n- The platform incorporates user feedback collection and adaptation, fostering informed decision-making and continuous improvement, in line with the objective of promoting user-centered design.\n\n**Support for Hypotheses:**\n- The platform's adaptability and customisation options allow users to test hypotheses regarding the impact of initial conditions, grid configurations, and game rules on emergent patterns and simulation efficiency.\n- By enabling users to manipulate experimental factors and observe their effects, the platform supports the hypothesis that tailored simulations can uncover novel insights into cellular automata dynamics.\n\n**Limitations:**\n1. **Computational Complexity:** The current implementation may struggle with extremely large grids or complex simulations due to computational limitations.\n2. **User Interface Customisation:** While the platform offers extensive customisation options, some users might find the user interface overwhelming or difficult to navigate.\n\n**Ideas for Future Work:**\n1. **Parallelisation and Performance Optimisation:** To address computational complexity, consider implementing parallel processing algorithms or optimising performance through hardware acceleration.\n2. **User Interface Simplification:** To improve usability, consider providing guided tutorials or tooltips for users, and simplifying the user interface without sacrificing functionality.\n\nThe memorised {key-gamlScript} serves as a robust foundation for this ABSS tool, effectively translating the conceptual design into a functional, adaptable simulation platform. It successfully incorporates all the necessary components to facilitate efficient exploration of cellular automata dynamics, catering to the specified objectives and hypotheses."}
