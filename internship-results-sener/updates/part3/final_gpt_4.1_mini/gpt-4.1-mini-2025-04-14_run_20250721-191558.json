An aim to simulate community-driven resource management strategies within the predator-prey dynamics would empower stakeholders and make the model socially relevant.\n\n**Environmental Policy Maker:** From a policy perspective, an aim to generate actionable scenarios that evaluate trade-offs between conservation and development is critical. The model should facilitate decision-making by illustrating consequences of policy interventions on both ecosystems and livelihoods.\n\n**Computational Modeler:** Balancing complexity is challenging. I suggest an aim to develop modular simulation components that allow toggling socio-economic variables on or off. This maintains ecological rigor while permitting exploration of socio-economic influences.\n\n**Agricultural Stakeholder:** Crop damage and pest management are real concerns.

Yet, overly complex models risk becoming black boxes, obscuring understanding and applicability for conservation practitioners.\n\n**Local Community Representative:** Usability is crucial for communities who may rely on simulation outcomes for resource management. The model must be accessible and interpretable, incorporating local knowledge without overwhelming users with technicalities.\n\n**Environmental Policy Maker:** From a policy standpoint, decision-makers need clear, actionable insights. If the model is too complex, it may hinder timely policy formulation. However, oversimplification might neglect key ecological feedbacks, undermining reliability.\n\n**Computational Modeler:** Striking the balance involves modular design. We can build layers of complexity that users can enable or disable, tailoring the simulation to their expertise and objectives. This preserves ecological realism while enhancing usability.\n\n**Agricultural Stakeholder:** For farmers, practical outcomes matter most, such as predicting pest outbreaks or crop damage risks.

However, it complicates isolating purely ecological effects, potentially obscuring key biological insights.\n\n**Local Community Representative:** Socio-economic behaviours are inseparable from ecosystem dynamics in real-world contexts. Ignoring them renders models less applicable to community resource management. Yet, capturing this complexity demands careful calibration to avoid misrepresentation.\n\n**Environmental Policy Maker:** Policy decisions hinge on understanding how human activities influence ecosystems. If socio-economic factors markedly change predictions, integrating them is essential. But complexity must be balanced with clarity to support effective governance.\n\n**Computational Modeler:** From a modelling standpoint, adding socio-economic behaviours introduces stochasticity and parameter uncertainty, challenging model validation. Nonetheless, modular approaches can mitigate complexity, allowing focused experiments to test these influences.\n\n**Agricultural Stakeholder:** Farming practices are socio-economic behaviours that directly affect predator-prey dynamics through land use and pest control.

However, it's tricky because environmental variability can mask effects. Still, it's a key experimental factor.\n\n**Local Community Representative:** From a social perspective, resource harvesting intensity by local communities must be included.

This helps in clarifying system boundaries, though it may complicate actor definitions.\n\n**Local Community Representative:** A \"Local Resource User\" actor is essential to represent community members who harvest vegetation and interact with wildlife. Capturing their decisions and constraints is critical, but defining heterogeneous behaviours can be challenging.\n\n**Environmental Policy Maker:** The \"Regulator\" actor must be included to represent policy enforcement agencies shaping habitat protection and human activity. It’s necessary for governance modelling but risks oversimplification if not nuanced.\n\n**Computational Modeler:** The \"Simulation Administrator\" actor should be recognized to manage model configurations and scenario executions, ensuring flexibility and user control. However, it is external to ecological processes.\n\n**Agricultural Stakeholder:** An \"Agricultural Producer\" actor is needed to embody farming activities, land use decisions, and pest management practices, linking socio-economic and ecological components. Yet, this role may overlap with local resource users.\n\n**Conservation Biologist:** Also consider a \"Predator Agent\" and a \"Prey Agent\" as actors, representing species with distinct behaviours; this promotes clarity in UML diagrams though it stretches traditional actor definitions.\n\n**Local Community Representative:** A \"Community Leader\" actor might be important to capture collective decision-making and knowledge dissemination, enriching social dynamics representation but increasing model complexity.\n\n**Environmental Policy Maker:** Finally, a \"Researcher\" actor could be included to represent scientific observers and model evaluators, facilitating feedback loops between simulation and empirical data.\n\n---\n\n**Moderator:** Summarizing, the eight potential ABSS UML actors are:\n\n1.

Generate the attributes, methods and relationships necessary to perform all {key-umlUseCases}. Add inheritance, composition, aggregation and association relationships.

  "Build upon {key-gamlScriptDraft3}. Generate an `experiment {...}` block, with `output {...}` and `display {...}` blocks inside it. The code must provide the necessary attributes and logic to allow users to manipulate all {key-experimentalFactors}, make sure to include memorised {key-experimentalFactors} as `parameter` variables in the `experiment` block, so its values can be modified, each parameter must have a corresponding variable in the `global` block. **You must implement all the code necessary for the simulation to meet the memorised {key-objectives} and experiments must allow for the user to verify the memorised {key-hypotheses}**. Make sure to include performance metrics for the memorised {key-objectives} and {key-hypotheses}. Each `species` (and the `global` block) must include all required attributes and logic to compute all {key-outputs}. The `experiment` block must display all {key-outputs}. Any species you want to visually display must be declared in the `display` block in `experiment` and must have a corresponding `aspect` in their species block, in the format: `aspect <aspect_name e.g. base> {\\n\\tdraw <shape e.g. circle>(size) color: #color;\\n}`. If {key-outputs} would benefit from supplementary txt/csv files, also add logic to output them.

The memorised objectives have been fulfilled by constructing detailed species definitions, implementing dynamic reflexes and actions for each agent, and enabling the manipulation of key experimental factors within an interactive experiment framework. This allows the exploration of socio-ecological interactions and provides measurable outputs such as sustainable harvesting statistics, policy compliance rates, crop yield impacts, and risk indices. These outputs serve as critical performance metrics aligned with the memorised objectives, supporting robust scenario analyses and decision-making processes.\n\nRegarding the memorised hypotheses, the simulation framework accommodates testing the influence of socio-economic behaviours on predator-prey population dynamics, emergent tipping points, human-wildlife conflict hotspots, and agricultural impacts. The reflexes and agent interactions systematically incorporate socio-economic and ecological factors, enabling empirical evaluation of hypotheses such as whether socio-economic behaviours significantly alter ecosystem stability or contribute to sudden collapses. The modularity and flexibility embedded within the design permit targeted experimentation on these hypotheses, thus providing a scientific basis to accept or reject them based on simulation outcomes.\n\nDespite these achievements, two limitations are apparent. First, the current model uses simplified representations for complex socio-ecological processes, such as random placeholders for socio-economic impact and tipping point detection, which may limit predictive accuracy. Second, the spatial and behavioural heterogeneity of agents and environments is relatively basic, potentially constraining realism. Future work should focus on integrating richer behavioural models and empirical data to enhance model fidelity and validating simulation results with real-world observations. Additionally, expanding spatial complexity and incorporating adaptive learning mechanisms among agents could significantly improve the system's ecological and social representativeness.\n\nThe memorised GAML script realizes the practical implementation of this conceptual framework, embedding the memorised objectives and hypotheses into executable simulation code. It offers a powerful platform for exploring interactions among stakeholders, environmental components, and policies in a controlled virtual environment. This integration underscores the capacity of Agent-Based Social Simulation to illuminate complex socio-ecological dynamics and inform sustainable ecosystem stewardship, fulfilling the overall aim of the study.\n```"
