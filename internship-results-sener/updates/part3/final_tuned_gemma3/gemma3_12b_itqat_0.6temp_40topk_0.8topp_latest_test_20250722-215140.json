Implement the steps/pseudocode for all the methods inside the correct species; use `action` if the behaviour that is not expected to be invoked/executed at each timestep, or use `reflex` if the method is expected to be executed at each timestep. **Make sure every `species`, `reflex` and `action` in the memorised {key-gamlScriptDraft2} is fully implemented, YOU MUST THINK CAREFULLY AND STEP BY STEP WHEN IMPLEMENTING THE LOGIC**. **Make sure every method declared in classes in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} is implemented as a `reflex` or `action` in the appropriate species**.

Actions accept arguments (enclosed in parentheses) or can accept no arguments. **If any of the reflexes/actions need to interact with another species, use interactions in {key-mermaidSequenceDiagramScript} and relationships in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} to connect the respective species using attributes, reflexes and actions**. All interactions between species must be defined inside the appropriate `species` block. For example, if `species1` calls an `action` or `reflex` named `move()` belonging to itself or another species then make sure `move()` is implemented in the appropriate block. Make sure all actions/reflexes that are invoked have been fully implemented. **Implement interactions between agents, for example, add the following in an appropriate `action` or `reflex` block inside `speciesA` to interact with `speciesB`: ```gaml\\nspecies A {\\n\\taction <species_A_action_name> {\\n\\t\\task speciesB {\\n\\t\\t\\tdo <species_B_action_name>;\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```**. **The body of each `action` and `reflex` must be implemented FULLY**.

Through a collaborative effort involving multiple roles \u2013 Management Expert, Software Developer, and stakeholders \u2013 we have successfully created a GAML script ({key-gamlScript}) that models key aspects of the scenario, allowing for the exploration of various experimental conditions. The simulation effectively incorporates the memorised {key-objectives}, namely measuring adoption rates and verifying the impact of various factors on patient adherence.\n\nThe simulation's ability to address the memorised {key-hypotheses} is particularly noteworthy. By manipulating parameters like temperature, adherence rate, infection rate, and recovery rate, we can observe their influence on patient infection and recovery patterns, providing valuable insights into the effectiveness of different intervention strategies. The GAML script allows for the creation of a dynamic and interactive environment, enabling us to test different scenarios and refine our understanding of the system. The implementation of the ABSS has demonstrated the feasibility of using agent-based modeling to simulate complex social and medical systems.\n\nHowever, the current implementation has limitations. Firstly, the model simplifies the decision-making processes of patients and healthcare providers, neglecting the influence of psychological factors and individual preferences. Secondly, the model does not account for the spatial dynamics of disease transmission, assuming a homogeneous population and neglecting the role of geographic factors. Future work could address these limitations by incorporating more sophisticated decision-making models and spatial dynamics. Furthermore, integrating real-world data, such as patient demographics and treatment histories, could enhance the model's accuracy and predictive power. Exploring the impact of policy interventions, such as public health campaigns and financial incentives, would also be a valuable avenue for future research.\n```\n"}
