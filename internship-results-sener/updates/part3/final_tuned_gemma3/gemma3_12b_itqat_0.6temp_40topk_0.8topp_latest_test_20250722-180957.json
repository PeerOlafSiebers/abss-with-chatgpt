The stakeholders materialize within the space.)**\n\n**Moderator:** Welcome, everyone. We're here today to collaboratively define the aims of our Agent-Based Social Simulation of FluX in Neo-Veridia. Let's be frank: this simulation needs to be useful, relevant, and acceptable to all of us. To kick things off, I'm going to throw out a somewhat random question: *If we could only predict ONE behaviour of Neo-Veridia's citizens during a FluX outbreak, what would it be and why?*\n\n**(A brief pause as the stakeholders consider the question.)**\n\n**Urban Planner:** I\u2019m going to jump in here. I believe we need to predict adherence to social distancing guidelines, specifically how it varies across different districts. Understanding this spatial variation is critical for targeted interventions. However, it\u2019s incredibly complex to model \u2013 people\u2019s behaviour is influenced by so many factors.\n\n**Local Business Owner:** With all due respect, predicting adherence is too vague. I need to know how different levels of restrictions \u2013 closures, capacity limits \u2013 will impact foot traffic and revenue. A simple \u201cadherence\u201d metric doesn't tell me anything useful.\n\n**Public Health Agency Representative:** While I appreciate the business owner\u2019s concerns, our priority is public health. Predicting adherence to guidelines is vital for projecting infection rates and hospitalisation pressures. We need a clear understanding of how effectively we can mitigate the spread.\n\n**Community Leader:** We need to be mindful of equity. Simply predicting adherence doesn\u2019t account for the fact that certain communities face greater barriers to following guidelines \u2013 lack of access to resources, language barriers, pre-existing health conditions. We need to understand *who* is adhering and *why*.\n\n**Data Scientist:** From a modelling perspective, predicting individual behaviour is incredibly challenging. We need to focus on identifying the key drivers of that behaviour \u2013 factors like perceived risk, social influence, and access to information.\n\n**(The discussion continues, with the stakeholders debating the merits of different approaches. The Public Health Agency Representative and the Urban Planner push for a focus on adherence, while the Local Business Owner advocates for a more economically-focused prediction.

We need to measure adherence to mask-wearing, at least. That's a direct indicator of risk mitigation.\n\n**Urban Planner:** I believe we need to measure social network interactions. Understanding who interacts with whom, and how those interactions vary across districts, is critical for modelling transmission patterns.

People's actions are driven by their beliefs about the threat posed by FluX. If we don't understand those perceptions, we can't predict how they're going to respond to interventions.\n\n**Data Scientist:** From a modelling perspective, measuring individual perceptions is incredibly challenging. It's difficult to translate subjective feelings into quantifiable data. We need to focus on observable behaviours that are easier to track and analyze.\n\n**(The discussion escalates.

Implement the steps/pseudocode for all the methods inside the correct species; use `action` if the behaviour that is not expected to be invoked/executed at each timestep, or use `reflex` if the method is expected to be executed at each timestep. **Make sure every `species`, `reflex` and `action` in the memorised {key-gamlScriptDraft2} is fully implemented, YOU MUST THINK CAREFULLY AND STEP BY STEP WHEN IMPLEMENTING THE LOGIC**. **Make sure every method declared in classes in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} is implemented as a `reflex` or `action` in the appropriate species**. Actions can be written using the following syntax: ```gaml\\nspecies <species_name> {\\n\\t// <declaration and initialisation of attributes e.g. float probability <- 0.5;>\\n\\t<action if return type is void, else a type e.g. float> <action_name>(<parameters_if_any e.g. float x>) {\\n\\t\\t// <logic e.g.>\\n\\t\\tif(probability < 0.5) {\\n\\t\\t\\tprobability <- probability * 10;\\n\\t\\t\\t...\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```.

Actions accept arguments (enclosed in parentheses) or can accept no arguments. **If any of the reflexes/actions need to interact with another species, use interactions in {key-mermaidSequenceDiagramScript} and relationships in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} to connect the respective species using attributes, reflexes and actions**. All interactions between species must be defined inside the appropriate `species` block. For example, if `species1` calls an `action` or `reflex` named `move()` belonging to itself or another species then make sure `move()` is implemented in the appropriate block. Make sure all actions/reflexes that are invoked have been fully implemented. **Implement interactions between agents, for example, add the following in an appropriate `action` or `reflex` block inside `speciesA` to interact with `speciesB`: ```gaml\\nspecies A {\\n\\taction <species_A_action_name> {\\n\\t\\task speciesB {\\n\\t\\t\\tdo <species_B_action_name>;\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```**. **The body of each `action` and `reflex` must be implemented FULLY**.

The simulation successfully integrates agent-based modelling principles with GAML code to create a dynamic system capable of simulating individual behaviours, interactions, and the impact of various interventions. The key objectives, namely quantifying the relationship between mask-wearing, transmission rates, and assessing the impact of interventions, are now addressed through the simulation's ability to track these variables and provide insights into their interdependencies. The verification of the hypothesis concerning the impact of temperature, mask effectiveness, and ventilation rate on transmission dynamics is now possible through the simulation's parameterization and data output.\n\nHowever, several limitations remain. Firstly, the model simplifies human behaviour, assuming a degree of rationality and adherence to guidelines that may not accurately reflect real-world scenarios. Secondly, the model\u2019s computational complexity limits the scale of the simulation and the level of detail that can be included. Future work should focus on incorporating more realistic behavioural models, such as those incorporating cognitive biases and social influence, and exploring techniques for scaling the simulation to larger populations and more detailed environments. Additionally, integrating real-world data, such as mobility patterns and demographic information, would enhance the model's accuracy and predictive power.\n\nThe {key-gamlScript} provides a functional, albeit simplified, framework for simulating the spread of flu within Neo-Veridia. It successfully translates the conceptual model defined by the {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} and the interactions outlined in the {key-mermaidSequenceDiagramScript} into executable code. While further refinement and expansion are necessary, the current version provides a valuable tool for exploring the potential impact of different interventions and informing public health policy. Future work should focus on incorporating more sophisticated data analysis techniques to extract meaningful insights from the simulation results and developing interactive visualizations to communicate these findings to a wider audience.\n```\n"}
