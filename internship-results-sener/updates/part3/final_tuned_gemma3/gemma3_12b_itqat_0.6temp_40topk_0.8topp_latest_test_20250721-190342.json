All interactions between species must be defined inside the appropriate `species` block. For example, if `species1` calls an `action` or `reflex` named `move()` belonging to itself or another species then make sure `move()` is implemented in the appropriate block. Make sure all actions/reflexes that are invoked have been fully implemented. **Implement interactions between agents, for example, add the following in an appropriate `action` or `reflex` block inside `speciesA` to interact with `speciesB`: ```gaml\\nspecies A {\\n\\taction <species_A_action_name> {\\n\\t\\task speciesB {\\n\\t\\t\\tdo <species_B_action_name>;\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```**. **The body of each `action` and `reflex` must be implemented FULLY**. For example, if you were implementing a ant-foraging model and wanted to implement an ant agent picking food up from a location, this could be implemented as: ```gaml\\naction pickUpFood (int amount) {\\n\\thas_food <- true;\\n\\tant_grid place <- ant_grid.location;\\n\\tplace.food <- place.food - amount;\\n}\\n```. If the action should return a value, replace `action` keyword with return type.

The development of the {key-gamlScript} represents a significant milestone, providing a working model that incorporates key ecological factors and allows for the manipulation of experimental parameters. This simulation directly addresses the {key-objectives} by providing a platform for measuring population dynamics, assessing the impact of environmental factors, and validating theoretical predictions. The incorporation of experimental factors such as temperature, predator hunting rate, and prey reproduction rate allows for the verification of the {key-hypotheses} concerning the influence of these factors on population sizes and ecosystem stability.\n\nHowever, the current work is not without limitations. Firstly, the model simplifies the complexity of the real-world ecosystem by neglecting crucial factors such as spatial heterogeneity, resource competition, and the influence of other species. Secondly, the model relies on a deterministic framework, failing to account for stochastic events and random fluctuations that can significantly impact ecological systems. Future work should address these limitations by incorporating spatial modelling techniques, implementing stochastic processes, and expanding the model to include a wider range of species and interactions. Furthermore, integrating data assimilation techniques to calibrate the model against empirical observations would enhance its predictive power and ecological relevance.\n\nLooking ahead, future research could focus on developing a spatially explicit model that simulates the dispersal of predators and prey within the cave system. Another avenue for exploration would be to incorporate a genetic component, allowing for the evolution of traits such as hunting efficiency and risk aversion. The {key-gamlScript} provides a solid foundation for these future advancements, demonstrating the feasibility of using agent-based modelling to investigate complex ecological phenomena and contributing to a deeper understanding of the intricate relationships within subterranean ecosystems.\n```\n"}
