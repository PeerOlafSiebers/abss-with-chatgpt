You will generate a GAML script for the GAMA simulation platform in a step-by-step prcoess according to my prompts. Use the contextual knowledge you have gathered. The GAML script must be syntatically correct, valid (for example using `<-` to initialise all variables as well as attributes inside species blocks). Use curly braces, rather than square brackets. The GAML script must start with the `model` keyword (`model <APPROPRIATE_MODEL_NAME>`). Firstly, create a `global` block which contains the necessary GAML code to initialise global variables and implement global methods from the artificial lab. The `global` block should also instantiate (create) the species (`species` is used to define the actors/systems/species from {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript}). The `global` block is created as follows: ```gaml\\nmodel <model_name>\\n\\nglobal {\\n\\t// global attributes e.g. float x <- 0.5;\\n\\t// global reflexes/actions ...\\n\\tinit {\\n\\t\\tcreate <species_name_1> number: <initial_population_of_species_name_1>;\\n\\t\\t...\\n\\t}\\n}\\n...\\n```.

The actual implementation of these methods as reflexes or actions in the appropriate species will be done later.", "Build upon {key-gamlScriptDraft2}. Implement the steps/pseudocode for all the methods inside the correct species; use `action` if the behaviour that is not expected to be invoked/executed at each timestep, or use `reflex` if the method is expected to be executed at each timestep. Make sure every species, reflex and action in the memorised {key-gamlScriptDraft} is fully implemented, YOU MUST THINK CAREFULLY AND STEP BY STEP WHEN IMPLEMENTING THE LOGIC. Make sure **every method declared in classes in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} is implemented as a reflex/action in the appropriate species**. Actions can be written using the following syntax: ```gaml\\nspecies <name> {\\n\\t<attribute_declaration_and_initialisation e.g. float probability <- 0.5;>\\n\\t<action if return type is void, else a type e.g. float> <action_name>(<parameters_if_any>) {\\n\\t\\t// logic e.g.\\n\\t\\tif(probability < 0.5) {\\n\\t\\t\\tprobability <- probability * 10;\\n\\t\\t\\t...\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```. Reflexes can be written using the following syntax: ```gaml\\nspecies <name> {\\n\\t<attribute_declaration_and_initialisation e.g. float probability <- 0.5;>\\n\\treflex <reflex_name> {\\n\\t\\t<logic>\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```. Actions accept arguments (enclosed in parentheses) or can accept no arguments. If any of the reflexes/actions need to interact with another species, use interactions in {key-mermaidSequenceDiagramScript} and relationships in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} to **connect the respective species using attributes, reflexes and actions**. All interactions between species must be defined inside the appropriate species block. For example, if `species1` calls an `action` or `reflex` named `move()` belonging to itself or another species then make sure `move()` is implemented in the appropriate block. Make sure all actions/reflexes that are invoked have been fully implemented. **Implement interactions between agents, for example, add the following in an appropriate `action` or `reflex` block inside `speciesA` to interact with `speciesB`: ```gaml\\nspecies A {\\n\\taction <species_A_action_name> {\\n\\t\\task speciesB {\\n\\t\\t\\tdo <species_B_action_name>;\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```**. **The body of each `action` and `reflex` must be implemented FULLY**. For example, if you were implementing a ant-foraging model and wanted to implement an ant agent picking food up from a location, this could be implemented as: ```gaml\\naction pickUpFood (int amount) {\\n\\thas_food <- true;\\n\\tant_grid place <- ant_grid(location);\\n\\tplace.food <- place.food - amount;\\n}\\n```.

For example, if `temperature` is one of the chosen experimental factors, `temperature` must be a parameter variable in the `experiment` block. You must implement all the code necessary for the simulation to meet the memorised chosen {key-objectives} and experiments must allow for user to verify memorised chosen {key-hypotheses}. For example, if a chosen hypothesis is that a rise in temperature increases number of population of an animal, implement all the logic needed to check this is true (allow user to manipulate temperature, increment population, output population or display visually). Make sure to include performance metrics for the memorised chosen {key-objectives} and chosen {key-hypotheses}. Each `species` (and the `global` block) must include all required attributes and logic to compute all {key-outputs} (do NOT simply write boilerplate code, I REQUIRE A FULL IMPLEMENTATION). The `experiment` block must display all {key-outputs}. For example, if ratio of infected to recovered patients is a chosen output of a flu epidemic scenario, the ratio must be calculated and output. Any species you want to visually display must be declared in the `display` block in `experiment` and must have a corresponding `aspect` in their species block, in the format: `aspect base {\\n\\t\\tdraw circle(size) color: color;\\n\\t}`. All of this logic must be correctly implemented in the appropriate code blocks. If {key-outputs} would benefit from supplementary txt/csv files, also add logic to output them.

Throughout our discussion, we have successfully achieved our objectives:\n\n1. **Disease Hotspot Management**: We created a detailed GAML script that models disease hotspot dynamics, allowing stakeholders to track, allocate resources, and implement interventions effectively.\n2. **Urban Design Optimization**: The model enables urban planners to evaluate and optimize urban form impacts on disease dynamics, adjusting designs to minimize disease dissemination.\n3. **Tool Validation and Integration**: Technologists can validate new tools, refine them based on user feedback, and integrate them seamlessly into the ABSS modeling framework.\n\nHowever, there are some limitations to our current work:\n\n1. **Limitation 1: Simplistic Assumptions**: Our model assumes certain conditions for simplicity, such as fixed resource allocation and intervention effectiveness. Real-world scenarios may require more complex assumptions.\n2. **Limitation 2: Limited Scalability**: The current model may not scale perfectly to larger or more complex systems without additional tuning.\n\nFor future work, we propose the following ideas:\n\n1. **Future Work 1: Incorporate Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Expand the model to include dynamic resource allocation based on real-time data and adaptive intervention strategies.\n2. **Future Work 2: Enhance Model Scalability**: Conduct thorough testing and optimization to ensure the model can scale effectively to larger systems.\n\nThe developed GAML script achieves a comprehensive simulation of the desired system, fitting perfectly into our hypotheses and objectives. It enables stakeholders to manage disease hotspots, optimize urban design, validate new tools, and collaborate effectively, ultimately advancing our understanding of disease dynamics and control strategies."}
