Species:**\n\n1. For each species, implement the methods inside the species block using the pseudocode provided above.\n2. Check if the method requires interactions with other species. If yes, include the necessary interactions in the method implementation.\n3. Test the implemented methods using sample inputs and validate their outputs.\n4. Iterate and refine the methods based on testing results and feedback from stakeholders.\n5. Once all methods are implemented and tested, integrate them into the GAML simulation platform.", "Build upon {key-gamlScriptDraft2}. Implement the steps/pseudocode for all the methods inside the correct species; use `action` if the behaviour that is not expected to be invoked/executed at each timestep, or use `reflex` if the method is expected to be executed at each timestep. Make sure every species, reflex and action in the memorised {key-gamlScriptDraft} is fully implemented, YOU MUST THINK CAREFULLY AND STEP BY STEP WHEN IMPLEMENTING THE LOGIC. Make sure **every method declared in classes in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} is implemented as a reflex/action in the appropriate species**. Actions can be written using the following syntax: ```gaml\\nspecies <name> {\\n\\t<attribute_declaration_and_initialisation e.g. float probability <- 0.5;>\\n\\t<action if return type is void, else a type e.g. float> <action_name>(<parameters_if_any>) {\\n\\t\\t// logic e.g.\\n\\t\\tif(probability < 0.5) {\\n\\t\\t\\tprobability <- probability * 10;\\n\\t\\t\\t...\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```. Reflexes can be written using the following syntax: ```gaml\\nspecies <name> {\\n\\t<attribute_declaration_and_initialisation e.g. float probability <- 0.5;>\\n\\treflex <reflex_name> {\\n\\t\\t<logic>\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```. Actions accept arguments (enclosed in parentheses) or can accept no arguments. If any of the reflexes/actions need to interact with another species, use interactions in {key-mermaidSequenceDiagramScript} and relationships in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} to **connect the respective species using attributes, reflexes and actions**. All interactions between species must be defined inside the appropriate species block. For example, if `species1` calls an `action` or `reflex` named `move()` belonging to itself or another species then make sure `move()` is implemented in the appropriate block. Make sure all actions/reflexes that are invoked have been fully implemented. **Implement interactions between agents, for example, add the following in an appropriate `action` or `reflex` block inside `speciesA` to interact with `speciesB`: ```gaml\\nspecies A {\\n\\taction <species_A_action_name> {\\n\\t\\task speciesB {\\n\\t\\t\\tdo <species_B_action_name>;\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```**. **The body of each `action` and `reflex` must be implemented FULLY**. For example, if you were implementing a ant-foraging model and wanted to implement an ant agent picking food up from a location, this could be implemented as: ```gaml\\naction pickUpFood (int amount) {\\n\\thas_food <- true;\\n\\tant_grid place <- ant_grid(location);\\n\\tplace.food <- place.food - amount;\\n}\\n```. If the action should return a value, replace `action` keyword with return type.

Generate an `experiment {...}` block, with `output {...}` and `display {...}` blocks inside it. The code must provide the necessary attributes and logic to allow users to manipulate all {key-experimentalFactors}, make sure to include memorised {key-experimentalFactors} as `parameter` variables in the `experiment` block, so its values can be modified, each parameter must have a corresponding variable in the `global` block. For example, if `temperature` is one of the chosen experimental factors, `temperature` must be a parameter variable in the `experiment` block. You must implement all the code necessary for the simulation to meet the memorised chosen {key-objectives} and experiments must allow for user to verify memorised chosen {key-hypotheses}. For example, if a chosen hypothesis is that a rise in temperature increases number of population of an animal, implement all the logic needed to check this is true (allow user to manipulate temperature, increment population, output population or display visually). Make sure to include performance metrics for the memorised chosen {key-objectives} and chosen {key-hypotheses}. Each `species` (and the `global` block) must include all required attributes and logic to compute all {key-outputs} (do NOT simply write boilerplate code, I REQUIRE A FULL IMPLEMENTATION). The `experiment` block must display all {key-outputs}. For example, if ratio of infected to recovered patients is a chosen output of a flu epidemic scenario, the ratio must be calculated and output. Any species you want to visually display must be declared in the `display` block in `experiment` and must have a corresponding `aspect` in their species block, in the format: `aspect base {\\n\\t\\tdraw circle(size) color: color;\\n\\t}`.

Only show the final, resulting markdown file code from this prompt. First, output \"Conclusion\" as Markdown 'Heading Level 3 ###'. Then: Write a 300 WORD (if possible) conclusion of the entire conversation history. Provide 3 paragraphs, testifying whether the aim has been achieved, refer to and answer the memorised {key-objectives} and memorised {key-hypotheses} in your conclusion. Also, provide 2 identified limitations of the current work, and propose 2 ideas for future work, based on these limitations. Also mention what the memorised {key-gamlScript} achieves and how it fits into the memorised {key-hypotheses} and memorised {key-objectives}. Memorise this conclusion as {key-conclusion}.": "### Conclusion\n\nThe Predator-Prey Corridor Simulation model has successfully addressed the key objectives and hypotheses outlined at the beginning of our conversation. Through the implementation of the GAML script, we have achieved the following:\n\n1. **Objective 1**: Enhance predator-prey dynamics while minimizing agricultural impacts has been successfully modeled by tracking predator-prey interactions, corridor usage efficiency, and human-wildlife coexistence throughout the simulation.\n2. **Objective 2**: Optimize corridor design for ecosystem resilience and human well-being has been effectively demonstrated by visualizing habitat suitability, corridor efficiency, and policy effectiveness metrics.\n\nHowever, there are two identified limitations in our current work:\n\n1. **Limitation 1**: The model assumes constant environmental conditions, which may not hold true in reality. Future work should consider incorporating climate change scenarios and other environmental fluctuations.\n2. **Limitation 2**: The model does not account for spatial heterogeneity in predator-prey interactions and habitat suitability. Future work should incorporate more detailed spatial data and models to better represent real-world conditions.\n\nThe GAML script achieves the following:\n\n- It implements a comprehensive agent-based simulation of the predator-prey corridor system, incorporating various species, their behaviors, and interactions.\n- It successfully integrates the memorised {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript}, {key-mermaidStateMachineDiagramsScript}, {key-mermaidSequenceDiagramScript}, and {key-gamlScriptDraft4} to create a functional model that meets the memorised {key-objectives} and {key-hypotheses}.\n- The script outputs relevant performance metrics, allowing users to verify the achievement of objectives and hypotheses.\n- It provides a visual representation of the simulation, displaying species movements and interactions, as well as various charts and graphs for data analysis.\n\nIn conclusion, the Predator-Prey Corridor Simulation model has successfully addressed the key objectives and hypotheses, providing valuable insights into predator-prey dynamics, corridor design, and ecosystem resilience. However, future work should consider addressing the identified limitations to further improve the model's realism and applicability."}
