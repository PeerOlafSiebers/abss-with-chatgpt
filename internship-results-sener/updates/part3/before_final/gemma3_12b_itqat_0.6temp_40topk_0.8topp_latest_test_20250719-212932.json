Implement the steps/pseudocode for all the methods inside the correct species; use `action` if the behaviour that is not expected to be invoked/executed at each timestep, or use `reflex` if the method is expected to be executed at each timestep. Make sure every species, reflex and action in the memorised {key-gamlScriptDraft} is fully implemented, YOU MUST THINK CAREFULLY AND STEP BY STEP WHEN IMPLEMENTING THE LOGIC. Make sure **every method declared in classes in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} is implemented as a reflex/action in the appropriate species**. Actions can be written using the following syntax: ```gaml\\nspecies <name> {\\n\\t<attribute_declaration_and_initialisation e.g. float probability <- 0.5;>\\n\\t<action if return type is void, else a type e.g. float> <action_name>(<parameters_if_any>) {\\n\\t\\t// logic e.g.\\n\\t\\tif(probability < 0.5) {\\n\\t\\t\\tprobability <- probability * 10;\\n\\t\\t\\t...\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```.

Actions accept arguments (enclosed in parentheses) or can accept no arguments. If any of the reflexes/actions need to interact with another species, use interactions in {key-mermaidSequenceDiagramScript} and relationships in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} to **connect the respective species using attributes, reflexes and actions**. All interactions between species must be defined inside the appropriate species block. For example, if `species1` calls an `action` or `reflex` named `move()` belonging to itself or another species then make sure `move()` is implemented in the appropriate block. Make sure all actions/reflexes that are invoked have been fully implemented. **Implement interactions between agents, for example, add the following in an appropriate `action` or `reflex` block inside `speciesA` to interact with `speciesB`: ```gaml\\nspecies A {\\n\\taction <species_A_action_name> {\\n\\t\\task speciesB {\\n\\t\\t\\tdo <species_B_action_name>;\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```**. **The body of each `action` and `reflex` must be implemented FULLY**.

Generate an `experiment {...}` block, with `output {...}` and `display {...}` blocks inside it. The code must provide the necessary attributes and logic to allow users to manipulate all {key-experimentalFactors}, make sure to include memorised {key-experimentalFactors} as `parameter` variables in the `experiment` block, so its values can be modified, each parameter must have a corresponding variable in the `global` block. For example, if `temperature` is one of the chosen experimental factors, `temperature` must be a parameter variable in the `experiment` block. You must implement all the code necessary for the simulation to meet the memorised chosen {key-objectives} and experiments must allow for user to verify memorised chosen {key-hypotheses}. For example, if a chosen hypothesis is that a rise in temperature increases number of population of an animal, implement all the logic needed to check this is true (allow user to manipulate temperature, increment population, output population or display visually). Make sure to include performance metrics for the memorised chosen {key-objectives} and chosen {key-hypotheses}. Each `species` (and the `global` block) must include all required attributes and logic to compute all {key-outputs} (do NOT simply write boilerplate code, I REQUIRE A FULL IMPLEMENTATION). The `experiment` block must display all {key-outputs}. For example, if ratio of infected to recovered patients is a chosen output of a flu epidemic scenario, the ratio must be calculated and output. Any species you want to visually display must be declared in the `display` block in `experiment` and must have a corresponding `aspect` in their species block, in the format: `aspect base {\\n\\t\\tdraw circle(size) color: color;\\n\\t}`. All of this logic must be correctly implemented in the appropriate code blocks. If {key-outputs} would benefit from supplementary txt/csv files, also add logic to output them.

Also mention what the memorised {key-gamlScript} achieves and how it fits into the memorised {key-hypotheses} and memorised {key-objectives}. Memorise this conclusion as {key-conclusion}.": "### Conclusion\n\nThe co-creation process culminating in the {key-gamlScript} has successfully achieved the primary aim of establishing a foundation for simulating and exploring emergent dynamics within a simplified cellular automaton model inspired by Conway\u2019s Game of Life. The script provides a functional framework for manipulating key parameters \u2013 temperature, resource availability, and simulation speed \u2013 allowing for the investigation of their influence on the system's behavior. The model, as implemented, directly addresses the memorised {key-objectives} by providing a platform for quantitative analysis of pattern diversity and stability under varying conditions. Furthermore, the script lays the groundwork for testing the memorised {key-hypotheses}, particularly the relationship between temperature and population dynamics, although further refinement and data collection are required to draw definitive conclusions.\n\nHowever, several limitations currently constrain the scope of the simulation. Firstly, the model lacks a detailed representation of agent behavior, relying on simplified interactions and lacking the complexity of individual decision-making processes. Secondly, the current implementation does not incorporate a robust visualization system beyond basic charts, limiting the ability to effectively communicate complex patterns and trends. To address these limitations, future work should focus on incorporating agent-based modeling techniques to simulate more realistic agent behaviors and developing a more interactive and informative visualization system, potentially leveraging external libraries for enhanced graphical representation.\n\nLooking ahead, potential avenues for future work include extending the model to incorporate environmental factors such as predation or competition, and exploring the use of machine learning techniques to predict emergent patterns and optimize simulation parameters. The {key-gamlScript}, as it stands, provides a valuable starting point for these endeavors, offering a functional and adaptable framework for simulating and analyzing complex systems, and paving the way for deeper exploration of the underlying dynamics.\n"}
