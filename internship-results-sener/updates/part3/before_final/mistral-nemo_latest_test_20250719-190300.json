The actual implementation will involve creating appropriate reflexes or actions in the GAML simulation platform based on these pseudocode steps.", "Build upon {key-gamlScriptDraft2}. Implement the steps/pseudocode for all the methods inside the correct species; use `action` if the behaviour that is not expected to be invoked/executed at each timestep, or use `reflex` if the method is expected to be executed at each timestep. Make sure every species, reflex and action in the memorised {key-gamlScriptDraft} is fully implemented, YOU MUST THINK CAREFULLY AND STEP BY STEP WHEN IMPLEMENTING THE LOGIC. Make sure **every method declared in classes in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} is implemented as a reflex/action in the appropriate species**. Actions can be written using the following syntax: ```gaml\\nspecies <name> {\\n\\t<attribute_declaration_and_initialisation e.g. float probability <- 0.5;>\\n\\t<action if return type is void, else a type e.g. float> <action_name>(<parameters_if_any>) {\\n\\t\\t// logic e.g.\\n\\t\\tif(probability < 0.5) {\\n\\t\\t\\tprobability <- probability * 10;\\n\\t\\t\\t...\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```. Reflexes can be written using the following syntax: ```gaml\\nspecies <name> {\\n\\t<attribute_declaration_and_initialisation e.g. float probability <- 0.5;>\\n\\treflex <reflex_name> {\\n\\t\\t<logic>\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```. Actions accept arguments (enclosed in parentheses) or can accept no arguments. If any of the reflexes/actions need to interact with another species, use interactions in {key-mermaidSequenceDiagramScript} and relationships in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} to **connect the respective species using attributes, reflexes and actions**. All interactions between species must be defined inside the appropriate species block. For example, if `species1` calls an `action` or `reflex` named `move()` belonging to itself or another species then make sure `move()` is implemented in the appropriate block. Make sure all actions/reflexes that are invoked have been fully implemented. **Implement interactions between agents, for example, add the following in an appropriate `action` or `reflex` block inside `speciesA` to interact with `speciesB`: ```gaml\\nspecies A {\\n\\taction <species_A_action_name> {\\n\\t\\task speciesB {\\n\\t\\t\\tdo <species_B_action_name>;\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```**. **The body of each `action` and `reflex` must be implemented FULLY**. For example, if you were implementing a ant-foraging model and wanted to implement an ant agent picking food up from a location, this could be implemented as: ```gaml\\naction pickUpFood (int amount) {\\n\\thas_food <- true;\\n\\tant_grid place <- ant_grid(location);\\n\\tplace.food <- place.food - amount;\\n}\\n```. If the action should return a value, replace `action` keyword with return type.

Generate an `experiment {...}` block, with `output {...}` and `display {...}` blocks inside it. The code must provide the necessary attributes and logic to allow users to manipulate all {key-experimentalFactors}, make sure to include memorised {key-experimentalFactors} as `parameter` variables in the `experiment` block, so its values can be modified, each parameter must have a corresponding variable in the `global` block. For example, if `temperature` is one of the chosen experimental factors, `temperature` must be a parameter variable in the `experiment` block. You must implement all the code necessary for the simulation to meet the memorised chosen {key-objectives} and experiments must allow for user to verify memorised chosen {key-hypotheses}. For example, if a chosen hypothesis is that a rise in temperature increases number of population of an animal, implement all the logic needed to check this is true (allow user to manipulate temperature, increment population, output population or display visually). Make sure to include performance metrics for the memorised chosen {key-objectives} and chosen {key-hypotheses}. Each `species` (and the `global` block) must include all required attributes and logic to compute all {key-outputs} (do NOT simply write boilerplate code, I REQUIRE A FULL IMPLEMENTATION). The `experiment` block must display all {key-outputs}. For example, if ratio of infected to recovered patients is a chosen output of a flu epidemic scenario, the ratio must be calculated and output. Any species you want to visually display must be declared in the `display` block in `experiment` and must have a corresponding `aspect` in their species block, in the format: `aspect base {\\n\\t\\tdraw circle(size) color: color;\\n\\t}`. All of this logic must be correctly implemented in the appropriate code blocks. If {key-outputs} would benefit from supplementary txt/csv files, also add logic to output them.

Memorise this conclusion as {key-conclusion}.": "### Conclusion\n\nThe comprehensive GAML simulation model, represented by the memorised {key-gamlScript}, has successfully achieved its aim of simulating software update adoption dynamics within a SaaS context. This model was designed to meet the memorised {key-objectives} of minimizing average time to adption, maximizing adoption rate, maintaining customer retention rate, enhancing social influence strength, and mitigating update impact on competition.\n\nThe model has been thoroughly implemented, incorporating all necessary attributes, methods, interactions, and logic from the artificial lab, classes, sequence diagrams, state machine diagrams, and state transitions. It has been validated through careful reflection and debugging, ensuring its correctness and completeness.\n\nIn terms of the memorised {key-hypotheses}, the model has been designed to test whether increasing collaboration strength factor leads to higher adoption rates, which has been implemented through the 'collaborationStrengthFactor' parameter in the experiment block. Similarly, other hypotheses such as the impact of update complexity level on adoption delay have been incorporated into the model.\n\nHowever, there are two identified limitations in the current work:\n\n1. **Limitation 1: Scope of Software Updates**: The current model focuses on a single software update and its adoption dynamics. In reality, SaaS users often face multiple updates simultaneously, which could introduce additional complexities not captured in this model.\n2. **Limitation 2: Lack of Real-World Data Validation**: While the model has been designed based on extensive contextual knowledge and logical reasoning, it has not been validated using real-world data from actual software update adoption scenarios.\n\nTwo ideas for future work to address these limitations are:\n\n1. **Future Work 1: Model Expansion**: To address Limitation 1, future work could involve expanding the current model to simulate multiple software updates simultaneously, allowing users to study the dynamics of competing updates and their potential interactions.\n2. **Future Work 2: Real-World Data Collection and Validation**: To address Limitation 2, future work could entail collecting real-world data from actual software update adoption scenarios and validating the current model against this data. This would provide a more accurate assessment of the model's predictive capabilities and its faithfulness to real-world dynamics.\n\nThe memorised {key-gamlScript} achieves a comprehensive simulation of software update adoption dynamics, fitting perfectly into the memorised {key-hypotheses} and {key-objectives}. It provides a powerful tool for users to manipulate experimental factors, observe outputs, and verify hypotheses, all while being visually displayed in real-time."}
