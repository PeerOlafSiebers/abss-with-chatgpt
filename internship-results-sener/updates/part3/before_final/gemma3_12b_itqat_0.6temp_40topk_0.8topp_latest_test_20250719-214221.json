We need aims that translate to actionable algorithms. My priority is ensuring the platform can handle a large user base. Aim 1: *Optimize module recommendation algorithms based on ABSS insights to increase overall user engagement by 15%*. It\u2019s measurable, scalable, and directly impacts platform performance.\n\n**Curriculum Designer (Thoughtful, prioritizing pedagogy):** While engagement is vital, we can't sacrifice learning depth. We need to ensure the recommendations align with pedagogical principles. Aim 2: *Identify optimal sequencing of modules to maximize knowledge retention and application across diverse learner profiles*. It\u2019s about creating a structured learning journey.\n\n**Learning Scientist (Analytical, focused on validity):** Both are good starting points, but we need to validate the model's assumptions.

DO NOT create classes with the same name. Delete all getter and setter methods. The Main class must be called `ArtificialLab`. Create only 1 `ArtificialLab` class. The `ArtificialLab` class must have array attributes for EACH Actor object and EACH Physical Environment object. The `ArtificialLab` class must contain appropriately named attribute names and methods to measure statistics for the memorised {key-objectives} AND memorised {key-hypotheses}.

Make sure every species, reflex and action in the memorised {key-gamlScriptDraft} is fully implemented, YOU MUST THINK CAREFULLY AND STEP BY STEP WHEN IMPLEMENTING THE LOGIC. Make sure **every method declared in classes in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} is implemented as a reflex/action in the appropriate species**.

Actions accept arguments (enclosed in parentheses) or can accept no arguments. If any of the reflexes/actions need to interact with another species, use interactions in {key-mermaidSequenceDiagramScript} and relationships in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} to **connect the respective species using attributes, reflexes and actions**. All interactions between species must be defined inside the appropriate species block. For example, if `species1` calls an `action` or `reflex` named `move()` belonging to itself or another species then make sure `move()` is implemented in the appropriate block. Make sure all actions/reflexes that are invoked have been fully implemented. **Implement interactions between agents, for example, add the following in an appropriate `action` or `reflex` block inside `speciesA` to interact with `speciesB`: ```gaml\\nspecies A {\\n\\taction <species_A_action_name> {\\n\\t\\task speciesB {\\n\\t\\t\\tdo <species_B_action_name>;\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```**. **The body of each `action` and `reflex` must be implemented FULLY**.

The aim of creating a functional simulation capable of testing hypotheses related to learning preferences, population dynamics, and engagement levels has been successfully achieved. The simulation allows for manipulation of key parameters, such as temperature and initial learner population, enabling the testing of hypotheses regarding the impact of these factors on learner engagement and overall system performance. Specifically, the simulation provides a framework for verifying the hypothesis that a rise in temperature (simulated through parameter manipulation) can influence the number of learners and their engagement levels.\n\nThe simulation directly addresses the memorised {key-objectives} by providing a platform for measuring learner population, engagement scores, and the impact of environmental factors. The {key-gamlScript} facilitates the collection of data on these metrics, allowing for quantitative analysis and verification of the proposed hypotheses. The GAMA model, with its ability to simulate complex interactions and dynamic behaviours, provides a valuable tool for understanding the underlying mechanisms driving learning and collaboration. The simulation's ability to visually represent learner populations and engagement scores, through the integrated charting capabilities, further enhances its utility for analysis and interpretation.\n\nDespite these successes, the current work has limitations. Firstly, the model's complexity is constrained by the need for computational efficiency, which limits the number of agents and the granularity of the simulation. Secondly, the model\u2019s current state does not fully incorporate the nuances of individual learning styles and preferences beyond a basic categorization. Future work could address these limitations by exploring techniques for parallel processing to increase simulation scale and by incorporating more sophisticated models of individual learning styles. Furthermore, integrating external data sources, such as real-world learning data, could enhance the model's realism and predictive power. The next step is to implement a robust visualization module to provide interactive data exploration and analysis capabilities.\n```\n\n## Memorised Keys:\n\n**{key-conclusion}:** See above.\n"}
