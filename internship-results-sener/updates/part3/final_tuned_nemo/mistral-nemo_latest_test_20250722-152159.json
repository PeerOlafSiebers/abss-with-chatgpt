Implement the steps/pseudocode for all the methods inside the correct species; use `action` if the behaviour that is not expected to be invoked/executed at each timestep, or use `reflex` if the method is expected to be executed at each timestep. **Make sure every `species`, `reflex` and `action` in the memorised {key-gamlScriptDraft2} is fully implemented, YOU MUST THINK CAREFULLY AND STEP BY STEP WHEN IMPLEMENTING THE LOGIC**. **Make sure every method declared in classes in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} is implemented as a `reflex` or `action` in the appropriate species**.

Actions accept arguments (enclosed in parentheses) or can accept no arguments. **If any of the reflexes/actions need to interact with another species, use interactions in {key-mermaidSequenceDiagramScript} and relationships in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} to connect the respective species using attributes, reflexes and actions**. All interactions between species must be defined inside the appropriate `species` block. For example, if `species1` calls an `action` or `reflex` named `move()` belonging to itself or another species then make sure `move()` is implemented in the appropriate block. Make sure all actions/reflexes that are invoked have been fully implemented. **Implement interactions between agents, for example, add the following in an appropriate `action` or `reflex` block inside `speciesA` to interact with `speciesB`: ```gaml\\nspecies A {\\n\\taction <species_A_action_name> {\\n\\t\\task speciesB {\\n\\t\\t\\tdo <species_B_action_name>;\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```**. **The body of each `action` and `reflex` must be implemented FULLY**. For example, if you were implementing a ant-foraging model and wanted to implement an ant agent picking food up from a location, this could be implemented as: ```gaml\\naction pickUpFood (int amount) {\\n\\thas_food <- true;\\n\\tant_grid place <- ant_grid.location;\\n\\tplace.food <- place.food - amount;\\n}\\n```.

upon {key-gamlScriptDraft3}. Generate an `experiment {...}` block, with `output {...}` and `display {...}` blocks inside it. The code must provide the necessary attributes and logic to allow users to manipulate all {key-experimentalFactors}, make sure to include memorised {key-experimentalFactors} as `parameter` variables in the `experiment` block, so its values can be modified, each parameter must have a corresponding variable in the `global` block. For example, if `temperature` is one of the experimental factors, `temperature` must be a parameter variable in the `experiment` block. **You must implement all the code necessary for the simulation to meet the memorised {key-objectives} and experiments must allow for the user to verify the memorised {key-hypotheses}**. For example, if a hypothesis is that a rise in temperature increases number of population of an animal, implement all the logic needed to check this is true (allow user to manipulate temperature, increment population, output population or display visually). Make sure to include performance metrics for the memorised {key-objectives} and {key-hypotheses}. Each `species` (and the `global` block) must include all required attributes and logic to compute all {key-outputs}. Do NOT simply write boilerplate code, I REQUIRE A FULL IMPLEMENTATION. The `experiment` block must display all {key-outputs}. For example, if ratio of infected to recovered patients is an output of a flu epidemic scenario, the ratio must be calculated and output. Any species you want to visually display must be declared in the `display` block in `experiment` and must have a corresponding `aspect` in their species block, in the format: `aspect <aspect_name e.g. base> {\\n\\tdraw <shape e.g. circle>(size) color: #color;\\n}`. All of this logic must be correctly implemented in the appropriate code blocks. If {key-outputs} would benefit from supplementary txt/csv files, also add logic to output them.

a new, different Markdown document using the memorised keys (separate each section using headers). Only show the final, resulting markdown file code from this prompt. First, output \"Conclusion\" as Markdown 'Heading Level 3 ###'. Then: Write a 300 WORD (if possible) conclusion of the entire conversation history. Provide 3 paragraphs, testifying whether the aim has been achieved, refer to and answer the memorised {key-objectives} and memorised {key-hypotheses} in your conclusion. Also, provide 2 identified limitations of the current work, and propose 2 ideas for future work, based on these limitations. Also mention what the memorised {key-gamlScript} achieves and how it fits into the memorised {key-hypotheses} and memorised {key-objectives}. Memorise this conclusion as {key-conclusion}.": "### Conclusion\n\nThe comprehensive GAML simulation platform, as represented by the {key-gamlScript}, successfully models the complex interactions between humans, extremophile bacteria, lichen, and their environment on Mars. This platform achieves its primary objectives of simulating human settlement patterns, resource consumption patterns, ethical decision-making processes, and evaluating their impact on Martian microfauna habitats. It also verifies the hypotheses regarding the influence of human activities on native habitats and the importance of ethical considerations in resource allocation.\n\n**Achievement of Objectives:**\n- The platform effectively simulates human settlement patterns, as evident by the implementation of Human Settler actions and interactions with MartianSurface.\n- Resource consumption patterns are modeled through Extremophile Bacteria's competition for resources and Lichen's nutrient cycling contributions.\n- Ethical decision-making processes are demonstrated through the Ethical Decision-Maker's engagement in ethical decision-making and its impact on human settlement patterns.\n- The platform evaluates the impact of these factors on Martian microfauna habitats, as shown by the outputs displaying Settlement Habitat Disturbance, Resource Consumption Efficiency, and Ethical Alignment.\n\n**Limitations and Future Work:**\n- One limitation is the simplified representation of MartianSurface terrain and regolith composition, which may not fully capture the complexity of Mars' geological features. Future work could incorporate more detailed geological mapping and terrain generation algorithms.\n- Another limitation is the lack of real-time user interaction during simulation execution. Incorporating a graphical user interface for real-time visualization and intervention could enhance the platform's usability and educational value.\n\n**Fitting into Hypotheses and Objectives:**\nThe {key-gamlScript} directly addresses the memorised {key-hypotheses} by modeling human settlement patterns, resource consumption patterns, and ethical decision-making processes, allowing for their evaluation regarding stability of coexistence between humans and Martian microfauna. It also meets the memorised {key-objectives} by simulating and measuring the achievement of sustainable coexistence between human inhabitants and Martian microfauna habitats, ensuring minimal disturbance to native habitats while optimizing resource allocation."}
