Definitions**\n\n- **Class:** In the context of UML, a class represents a blueprint for creating objects, defining their attributes, methods, and relationships to other classes.\n- **Class Diagram:** A visual representation of the structure of a system, showing its classes, objects, and their relationships, often used to model static structures.\n- **State Chart:** A graphical representation of an object's life cycle, showing its different states and the transitions between them, along with any associated actions or events.\n- **State Variable:** A variable that represents the current state of an object within a state chart, determining its behaviour and transitions.\n\n**Example Class Diagram for Coral Polyps:**\n\n```mermaid\nclass CoralPolyp {\n  -id: int\n  -status: StateVariable {Alive, Dead}\n  -neighbours: List<CoralPolyp>\n  -growthRate: float\n  -reproductionRate: float\n}\n\nCoralPolyp -->*:\"Neighbour Cells\": CoralPolyp\n```\n\n**Example State Chart for Coral Polyps:**\n\n```mermaid\nstateDiagram\n  [Alive] -->[Reproduce]: [Alive with Neighbours]\n  [Alive with Neighbours] -->[Die]: [Dead]\n  [Dead] -->[Revive]: [Alive]\n```", "Generate a script for a 'comprehensive class diagram' in \"Mermaid.js\". Start the script with `classDiagram`. **Define a class for each of the Actor and Physical Environment categories in the memorised {key-modelScope}**. Add collective classes for individual actors where appropriate (example: bird > flock, example: grape > bunch, DO NOT USE THESE EXAMPLES IF THEY DO NOT APPLY). DO NOT create abstract classes. DO NOT create classes with the same name. Delete all getter and setter methods. The Main class must be called `ArtificialLab`. Create only 1 `ArtificialLab` class. The `ArtificialLab` class must have array attributes for EACH Actor object and EACH Physical Environment object. The `ArtificialLab` class must contain appropriately named attribute names and methods to measure statistics for the memorised {key-objectives} AND verify the memorised {key-hypotheses}. Generate the attributes, methods and relationships necessary to perform all {key-umlUseCases}. **Relationships between classes can be defined using the following at the end of the script: `<|--` for inheritance, `*--` for composition, `o--` for aggregation and `-->` for association**. For example, if `class1` inherits attributes or behaviour (methods) from `class2` this is denoted as `class1 <|-- class2: <meaningful_label_here>`. Feel free to be creative and add your ideas.

A reminder; Relationships can be defined using the following at the end of the script: `<|--` for inheritance, `*--` for composition, `o--` for aggregation and `-->` for association. For example, if `class1` inherits attributes or behaviour (methods) from `class2` this is denoted as `class1 <|-- class2: <meaningful_label_here>`. Use the correct type of relationship for each relationship. For example, if it makes sense for one class to contain an instance of another for its use cases, use composition or aggregation.

Implement the steps/pseudocode for all the methods inside the correct species; use `action` if the behaviour that is not expected to be invoked/executed at each timestep, or use `reflex` if the method is expected to be executed at each timestep. **Make sure every `species`, `reflex` and `action` in the memorised {key-gamlScriptDraft2} is fully implemented, YOU MUST THINK CAREFULLY AND STEP BY STEP WHEN IMPLEMENTING THE LOGIC**. **Make sure every method declared in classes in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} is implemented as a `reflex` or `action` in the appropriate species**. Actions can be written using the following syntax: ```gaml\\nspecies <species_name> {\\n\\t// <declaration and initialisation of attributes e.g. float probability <- 0.5;>\\n\\t<action if return type is void, else a type e.g. float> <action_name>(<parameters_if_any e.g. float x>) {\\n\\t\\t// <logic e.g.>\\n\\t\\tif(probability < 0.5) {\\n\\t\\t\\tprobability <- probability * 10;\\n\\t\\t\\t...\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```. Reflexes can be written using the following syntax: ```gaml\\nspecies <species_name> {\\n\\t// <declaration and initialisation of attributes e.g. float probability <- 0.5;>\\n\\treflex <reflex_name> {\\n\\t\\t// <logic>\\n\\t...\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```. Actions accept arguments (enclosed in parentheses) or can accept no arguments. **If any of the reflexes/actions need to interact with another species, use interactions in {key-mermaidSequenceDiagramScript} and relationships in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} to connect the respective species using attributes, reflexes and actions**. All interactions between species must be defined inside the appropriate `species` block. For example, if `species1` calls an `action` or `reflex` named `move()` belonging to itself or another species then make sure `move()` is implemented in the appropriate block. Make sure all actions/reflexes that are invoked have been fully implemented. **Implement interactions between agents, for example, add the following in an appropriate `action` or `reflex` block inside `speciesA` to interact with `speciesB`: ```gaml\\nspecies A {\\n\\taction <species_A_action_name> {\\n\\t\\task speciesB {\\n\\t\\t\\tdo <species_B_action_name>;\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```**. **The body of each `action` and `reflex` must be implemented FULLY**. For example, if you were implementing a ant-foraging model and wanted to implement an ant agent picking food up from a location, this could be implemented as: ```gaml\\naction pickUpFood (int amount) {\\n\\thas_food <- true;\\n\\tant_grid place <- ant_grid.location;\\n\\tplace.food <- place.food - amount;\\n}\\n```.

For example, if `temperature` is one of the experimental factors, `temperature` must be a parameter variable in the `experiment` block. **You must implement all the code necessary for the simulation to meet the memorised {key-objectives} and experiments must allow for the user to verify the memorised {key-hypotheses}**. For example, if a hypothesis is that a rise in temperature increases number of population of an animal, implement all the logic needed to check this is true (allow user to manipulate temperature, increment population, output population or display visually). Make sure to include performance metrics for the memorised {key-objectives} and {key-hypotheses}. Each `species` (and the `global` block) must include all required attributes and logic to compute all {key-outputs}. Do NOT simply write boilerplate code, I REQUIRE A FULL IMPLEMENTATION. The `experiment` block must display all {key-outputs}. For example, if ratio of infected to recovered patients is an output of a flu epidemic scenario, the ratio must be calculated and output. Any species you want to visually display must be declared in the `display` block in `experiment` and must have a corresponding `aspect` in their species block, in the format: `aspect <aspect_name e.g. base> {\\n\\tdraw <shape e.g. circle>(size) color: #color;\\n}`. All of this logic must be correctly implemented in the appropriate code blocks. If {key-outputs} would benefit from supplementary txt/csv files, also add logic to output them.

The model aims to simulate the dynamics of a coral reef ecosystem under varying conditions, with the ultimate goal of verifying two key hypotheses:\n\n1. **Hypothesis on Temperature**: The model allows users to manipulate the temperature parameter, which is expected to influence the growth rate of Coral Polyps. Through visualisation of growth rates over time and supplementary outputs, users can verify if an increase in temperature leads to an increase in growth rate, as predicted.\n2. **Hypothesis on Intervention**: The model enables users to manipulate intervention strength and frequency parameters, which are expected to influence the population dynamics of Coral Polyps. By analysing the population displays and supplementary outputs, users can verify if interventions indeed affect the population size, as anticipated.\n\nThe model has achieved its objectives by providing a comprehensive simulation platform that allows users to:\n\n- Manipulate experimental factors (temperature, intervention strength, intervention frequency) to observe their effects on the ecosystem.\n- Visualise and analyse the growth rates, population dynamics, and temperature over time to verify the hypotheses.\n- Output supplementary data in txt and csv formats for further analysis.\n\nHowever, there are two identified limitations of the current work:\n\n1. **Limitation on Species Interaction**: The current model focuses primarily on the interactions between Coral Polyps and interventions. Incorporating more complex interactions between other species, such as competition or predation, could provide a more realistic representation of the ecosystem.\n2. **Limitation on Spatial Heterogeneity**: The current model assumes a homogeneous grid with uniform boundary conditions. Introducing spatial heterogeneity, such as varying boundary conditions or non-uniform grid sizes, could provide a more realistic representation of real-world reef ecosystems.\n\nFor future work, based on these limitations, two ideas are proposed:\n\n1. **Expansion of Species Interaction**: Incorporating more diverse species and their interactions would allow for a more comprehensive exploration of the ecosystem's dynamics.\n2. **Introduction of Spatial Heterogeneity**: Implementing varying boundary conditions or non-uniform grid sizes could provide a more realistic representation of real-world reef ecosystems, enabling users to investigate the effects of spatial heterogeneity on the ecosystem's behaviour.\n\nIn conclusion, the developed GAML simulation model, represented by {key-gamlScript}, successfully achieves its objectives by providing a comprehensive platform for simulating and analysing the dynamics of a coral reef ecosystem under varying conditions. It enables users to verify key hypotheses, manipulate experimental factors, and observe the effects on the ecosystem. The model serves as a valuable tool for investigating the complex interactions within an ecological system and provides a solid foundation for future work in this domain."}
