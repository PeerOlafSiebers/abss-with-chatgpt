You will generate a GAML script for the GAMA simulation platform in a step-by-step prcoess according to my prompts. Use the contextual knowledge you have gathered. The GAML script must be syntatically correct AND valid (for example using `<-` to initialise all variables as well as attributes inside species blocks). Use curly braces, rather than square brackets. The GAML script must start with the `model` keyword (`model <APPROPRIATE_MODEL_NAME>`). Firstly, create a `global` block which contains the necessary GAML code to initialise global variables and implement global methods from the ArtificialLab as reflexes. The `global` block should also instantiate (create) the `species` (`species` is used to define the actors/systems/species from {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript}). The `global` block is created as follows: ```gaml\\nmodel <gaml_model_name>\\n\\nglobal {\\n\\t// <declaration and initialisation of global attributes e.g. float x <- 0.5;>\\n\\t// global reflexes ...\\n\\treflex foo {\\n\\t\\t// <logic for each global method from ArtificialLab>\\n\\t\\t...\\n\\t}\\n\\tinit {\\n\\t\\t// create species\\n\\t\\tcreate <species_name_1> number: <initial_population_of_species_name_1>;\\n\\t\\t...\\n\\t}\\n}\\n...\\n```.

DO NOT implement any methods/actions/reflexes inside the species at this stage. An example species scaffold can be found below: ```gaml\\nmodel <gaml_model_name>\\n\\nglobal {\\n\\t// <declaration and initialisation of global attributes e.g. float x <- 0.5;>\\n\\t// global reflexes ...\\n\\treflex foo {\\n\\t\\t// <logic for each global method from ArtificialLab>\\n\\t\\t...\\n\\t}\\n\\tinit {\\n\\t\\t// create species\\n\\t\\tcreate <species_name_1> number: <initial_population_of_species_name_1>;\\n\\t\\t...\\n\\t}\\n}\\nspecies <species_name> {\\n\\t// <declaration and initialisation of attributes e.g. float probability <- 0.5;>\\n}\\n```.

    {
        "gamlStep3": "Build upon {key-gamlScriptDraft2}. Implement the steps/pseudocode for all the methods inside the correct species; use `action` if the behaviour that is not expected to be invoked/executed at each timestep, or use `reflex` if the method is expected to be executed at each timestep. **Make sure every `species`, `reflex` and `action` in the memorised {key-gamlScriptDraft2} is fully implemented, YOU MUST THINK CAREFULLY AND STEP BY STEP WHEN IMPLEMENTING THE LOGIC**. **Make sure every method declared in classes in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} is implemented as a `reflex` or `action` in the appropriate species**. Actions can be written using the following syntax: ```gaml\\nspecies <species_name> {\\n\\t// <declaration and initialisation of attributes e.g. float probability <- 0.5;>\\n\\t<action if return type is void, else a type e.g. float> <action_name>(<parameters_if_any e.g. float x>) {\\n\\t\\t// <logic e.g.>\\n\\t\\tif(probability < 0.5) {\\n\\t\\t\\tprobability <- probability * 10;\\n\\t\\t\\t...\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```. Reflexes can be written using the following syntax: ```gaml\\nspecies <species_name> {\\n\\t// <declaration and initialisation of attributes e.g. float probability <- 0.5;>\\n\\treflex <reflex_name> {\\n\\t\\t// <logic>\\n\\t...\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```. Actions accept arguments (enclosed in parentheses) or can accept no arguments. **If any of the reflexes/actions need to interact with another species, use interactions in {key-mermaidSequenceDiagramScript} and relationships in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} to connect the respective species using attributes, reflexes and actions**. All interactions between species must be defined inside the appropriate `species` block. For example, if `species1` calls an `action` or `reflex` named `move()` belonging to itself or another species then make sure `move()` is implemented in the appropriate block. Make sure all actions/reflexes that are invoked have been fully implemented. **Implement interactions between agents, for example, add the following in an appropriate `action` or `reflex` block inside `speciesA` to interact with `speciesB`: ```gaml\\nspecies A {\\n\\taction <species_A_action_name> {\\n\\t\\task speciesB {\\n\\t\\t\\tdo <species_B_action_name>;\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```**. **The body of each `action` and `reflex` must be implemented FULLY**. For example, if you were implementing a ant-foraging model and wanted to implement an ant agent picking food up from a location, this could be implemented as: ```gaml\\naction pickUpFood (int amount) {\\n\\thas_food <- true;\\n\\tant_grid place <- ant_grid.location;\\n\\tplace.food <- place.food - amount;\\n}\\n```. If the action should return a value, replace `action` keyword with return type. Output your full GAML script so far and save as {key-gamlScriptDraft3}."

        "gamlStep4": "Build upon {key-gamlScriptDraft3}. Generate an `experiment {...}` block, with `output {...}` and `display {...}` blocks inside it. The code must provide the necessary attributes and logic to allow users to manipulate all {key-experimentalFactors}, make sure to include memorised {key-experimentalFactors} as `parameter` variables in the `experiment` block, so its values can be modified, each parameter must have a corresponding variable in the `global` block. For example, if `temperature` is one of the experimental factors, `temperature` must be a parameter variable in the `experiment` block. **You must implement all the code necessary for the simulation to meet the memorised {key-objectives} and experiments must allow for the user to verify the memorised {key-hypotheses}**. For example, if a hypothesis is that a rise in temperature increases number of population of an animal, implement all the logic needed to check this is true (allow user to manipulate temperature, increment population, output population or display visually). Make sure to include performance metrics for the memorised {key-objectives} and {key-hypotheses}. Each `species` (and the `global` block) must include all required attributes and logic to compute all {key-outputs}. Do NOT simply write boilerplate code, I REQUIRE A FULL IMPLEMENTATION. The `experiment` block must display all {key-outputs}. For example, if ratio of infected to recovered patients is an output of a flu epidemic scenario, the ratio must be calculated and output. Any species you want to visually display must be declared in the `display` block in `experiment` and must have a corresponding `aspect` in their species block, in the format: `aspect <aspect_name e.g. base> {\\n\\tdraw <shape e.g. circle>(size) color: #color;\\n}`.
