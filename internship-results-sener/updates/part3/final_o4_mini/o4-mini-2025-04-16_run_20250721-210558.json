  "Generate a script for a 'comprehensive class diagram' in \"Mermaid.js\". Start the script with `classDiagram`. **Define a class for each of the Actor and Physical Environment categories in the memorised {key-modelScope}**. Add collective classes for individual actors where appropriate (example: bird > flock). DO NOT create abstract classes. Delete all getter and setter methods. The Main class must be called `ArtificialLab`. The `ArtificialLab` class must have array attributes for EACH Actor object and EACH Physical Environment object. The `ArtificialLab` class must contain appropriately named attribute names and methods to measure statistics for the memorised {key-objectives} AND verify the memorised {key-hypotheses}. Generate the attributes, methods and relationships necessary to perform all {key-umlUseCases}. Add inheritance, composition, aggregation and association relationships.

  "Now, write a new, different Markdown document (separate each section using headers). Only show the final, resulting markdown file code from this prompt. First, output \"Conclusion\" as Markdown 'Heading Level 3 ###'. Then: Write a 300 WORD (if possible) conclusion of the entire conversation history. Provide 3 paragraphs, testifying whether the aim has been achieved, refer to and answer the memorised {key-objectives} and memorised {key-hypotheses} in your conclusion. Also, provide 2 identified limitations of the current work, and propose 2 ideas for future work, based on these limitations. Also mention what the memorised {key-gamlScript} achieves and how it fits into the memorised {key-hypotheses} and memorised {key-objectives}. Memorise this conclusion as {key-conclusion}.": "### Conclusion\n\nOver the course of this co‐creation process, we have realized the stated aim of quantifying how culturally adaptive panel designs and spatial clustering co‐influence adoption speed, environmental service delivery, and community satisfaction, as well as evaluating policy‐driven incentives and production‐cost structures for culturally customized panels to maximize equitable adoption and ecological efficacy. The two exploratory objectives—(1) measuring the modulation of Bass parameters (innovation and imitation) by real‐time ecological feedback displays within varied urban morphologies, and (2) assessing the trade‐offs between sensor/display system complexity and sustained adoption momentum—have been clearly specified and embedded into the model architecture. Likewise, the hypotheses concerning transient imitation surges under intermittent flash incentives and the moderating effect of socio‐cultural cohesion have been formalized for rigorous testing within the simulation.\n\nThe resulting GAML script for the GAMA platform operationalizes all facets of the “ArtificialLab” framework. It defines species for City Planning Authorities, Community Representatives, Manufacturers, Policy Incentive Managers, Vertical Green Corridors, Environmental Sensor Networks, and experimental factor objects. Global reflexes compute innovation and imitation coefficients, complexity–momentum trade‐offs, hypothesis verifications, and temporal outputs (adoption curves, cost‐per‐adopter efficiency, resilience scores, spatial adoption maps, and ecological summaries). Stakeholder behaviors, inter‐agent interactions, state transitions, and UML‐inspired use cases are fully implemented, enabling end‐users to manipulate incentive timing, cohesion levels, and subsidy magnitudes, then observe measurable impacts on both objectives and hypotheses.\n\nDespite these achievements, two key limitations remain:  \n• The psychological model is simplified to a single Self‐Determination–inspired score, omitting richer cognitive and emotional dynamics.  \n• Socio‐cultural cohesion is static rather than evolving through peer influence and network rewiring.  \n\nTo address these gaps, future work should:  \n1) Integrate dynamic social network evolution and adaptive rewiring to capture real–time shifts in referral patterns and trust networks.  \n2) Incorporate multi‐dimensional cognitive architectures or bounded‐rationality heuristics to represent heterogeneous motivations, risk tolerances, and habit formation.  \n\nThese enhancements will build on the existing GAML framework, further improve the fidelity of diffusion dynamics, and strengthen the model’s policy‐relevance for urban sustainability initiatives."
