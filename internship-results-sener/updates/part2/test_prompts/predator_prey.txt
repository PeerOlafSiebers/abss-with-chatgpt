Key Topic: The goal of this study is to generate IDEAS for: applying the predator-prey cycle.The predator-prey model simulates the interactions between two species: predators and preys, within a grid-like environment where vegetation cells represent areas where vegetation grows. Preys feed on the vegetation which regenerates at each simulation step, while predators hunt and consume preys to gain energy. Both species follow specific behaviors: they move to neighboring cells, consume available resources (preys or vegetation), and lose energy over time. If their energy drops too low, they die. However, if they maintain sufficient energy, they can reproduce, contributing to population dynamics.
