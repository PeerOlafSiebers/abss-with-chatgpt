Initialisation must take place in an \"init {...}\" block nested inside the \"global {...}\" block. Make sure to include \"parameter\" variables in the \"experiment\" block, if you think a modelling specialist would like to alter its value. Memorise this as {key-gamlScriptDraft}. An example gaml script scaffold is below:\\n```\\nmodel <gaml_model_name>\\nglobal {\\n\\t...\\n\\tinit {\\n\\t\\t...\\n\\t}\\n}\\nspecies <name> {\\n\\t<attribute_declaration_and_initialisation e.g. float probability <- 0.5;>\\n\\treflex <reflex_name> {\\n\\t\\t<logic>\\n\\t}\\n\\taction <action_name>(<parameters_if_any>) {\\n\\t\\t<logic>\\n\\t}\\n}\\nspecies <another_species> {\\n\\t...\\n}\\nexperiment {\\n\\tparameter <parameter_name> var:<name_of_linked_attribute> <parameter_options>;\\n\\toutput {\\n\\t\\t...\\n\\t}\\n\\tdisplay <display_1_name> {\\n\\t\\t//if you want to visually show species\\n\\t\\tspecies <species_to_visually_display> aspect: <aspect_name>;\\n\\t}\\n\\t//display other outputs separately (such as charts)...\\n\\tdisplay <display_2_name> {\\n\\t\\t...}\\n```"

        "keyGamlScriptDraft2": "Make sure every species, reflex and action in the memorised {key-gamlScriptDraft} is fully implemented, YOU MUST THINK CAREFULLY AND STEP BY STEP WHEN IMPLEMENTING THEM. For example, if a species named \"species1\" calls an action/reflex named \"move()\" belonging to itself or another species then make sure \"move()\" is implemented in the appropriate block. Make sure any calls to actions inside species blocks or references to species have implementations. Make sure each functionality declared in classes in {key-mermaidClassDiagramScript} has been implemented in the appropriate species. REFLECT and IMPROVE the script based on your reflection. Find and remove any GAML errors. Memorise this as {key-gamlScriptDraft2}."

        "keyGamlScript": "Build upon {key-gamlScriptDraft2}. Each \"species\" (and the \"global\" block) must include all required attributes and logic to compute all {key-outputs} (do NOT simply write boilerplate code, I REQUIRE A FULL IMPLEMENTATION). The \"experiment\" block must display all {key-outputs}. Additionally, the code must provide the necessary attributes and logic to allow users to manipulate all {key-experimentalFactors}. Make sure all memorised {key-umlActors} and their corresponding UML User Stories have been implemented. Make sure the code meets the memorised {key-objectives} and measures statistics for the memorised {key-objectives} AND memorised {key-hypotheses}. All of this logic must be correctly implemented in the appropriate code blocks. Any species you want to visually display must be declared in the \"display\" block in \"experiment\" and must have a corresponding \"aspect\" in their species block, in the format: `aspect base {\n\t\tdraw circle(size) color: color;\n\t}`. If {key-outputs} would benefit from txt/csv files, add logic to output them. Finally, make sure all species have been \"created\" inside the \"init\" block of the \"global\" block, using the following syntax `create <species_name_1> number: <initial_population_of_species_name_1>;`. Memorise this as {key-gamlScript}."

Only show the final, resulting markdown file code from this prompt. First, output \"Conclusion\" as Markdown 'Heading Level 3 ###'. Then: Write a 300 WORD (if possible) conclusion of the entire conversation history. Provide 3 paragraphs, testifying whether the aim has been achieved, refer to and answer the memorised {key-objectives} and memorised {key-hypotheses} in your conclusion. Also, provide 2 identified limitations of the current work, and propose 2 ideas for future work, based on these limitations.
