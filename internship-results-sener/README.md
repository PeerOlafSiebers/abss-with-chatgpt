All resources pertaining to my internship can be found in the `main` folder.

After my internship concluded, I continued to look into how to streamline EABSS with generative AI in my spare time. This was not funded. All resources pertaining to this work can be found in the `updates` folder. I have organised my work into `part2` and `part3` for work done over Winter 2024/2025 and Summer 2025 respectively.

Please reference the reports in each of `main`, `updates/part2`, `updates/part3` to understand the files and subfolders at that directory level.
